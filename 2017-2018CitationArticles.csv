A statistical design of experiments (central composite design) was employed for developing anti-icing liquids consisting of cost-competitive chemicals such as renewable agro-based compounds (Concord grape extract and glycerin); sodium chloride; sodium metasilicate; and sodium formate. The following experimentally obtained parameters were examined as a function of the formulation design: ice-melting capacity at -3.9 degrees C, splitting tensile strength of portland cement mortar samples after 10 freeze-thaw/deicer cycles, corrosion rate of C1010 carbon steel after 24-h immersion, and impact on low temperature performance of asphalt binder. One viable formula (the best performer) was tested for thermal properties by measuring its differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms and other properties (friction coefficient on anti-iced asphalt pavement, pH, oxygen demands). These laboratory data shed light on the selection and formulation of innovative agro-based snow and ice control chemicals that can significantly reduce the costs of winter road maintenance operations.

Therefore, the degree of ductility becomes significant in seismic regions. This paper investigates the influence of poly-vinyl alcohol fibers, basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) and carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) fabrics on the ductility and mechanical performance of low (LCFA) and high (HCFA) calcium fly ash-based engineered cementitious composite concrete. The study also focuses on the mechanical behaviour of the CFRP and BFRP materials using different matrix types exposed to 3.5% seawater environment. Cyclic loading and scanning electron microscopy observations were also performed to see the effect of chloride attack on mechanical performance and ductility of the specimens. In addition, utilization of CFRP and BFRP fabrics as a retrofit material is also evaluated. Results indicated that the degree of ductility and mechanical performance were found to be superior for the CFRP-engineered cementitious composite hybrid specimens under ambient environment, while LCFA-CFRP hybrid specimens showed better performance under seawater environment. The effect of matrix type was also found significant when engineered cementitious composite is used together with fiber-reinforced polymer materials. In addition, both fiber-reinforced polymer materials can be used as a retrofit material under seawater environment.

Two novel theoretical models have been built to predict the tensile strength and Young's modulus of FDM additive manufacturing PLA material with different printing angles and layer thicknesses in this study. Firstly, strength theoretical model is established based on transversely isotropic material hypothesis and Tsai-Hill strength criterion. Then, Young's modulus theoretical model is established based on orthotropic material hypothesis under plane stress state. Test data indicates that the tensile strength and Young's Modulus of FDM additive manufacturing PLA material increase as the printing angle increases or the layer thickness decreases. Relative Error (RE) between theoretical results and test data is put forward as a criterion to evaluate the accuracy of the theoretical models quantitatively. All the Relative Error are so small (<= 0.14) that is satisfactory in engineering applications. Therefore, one can confirm that the theoretical models established during this research can predict the tensile strength and Young's modulus of FDM additive manufacturing PLA material with different printing angles and layer thicknesses precisely.

The experiments were first launched with rheological property determination tests. Bleeding, setting time, and viscosity tests were performed on superfine-cement suspensions with or without silica fume in different water/cement (W/C) ratios. Then, groutability tests were performed on fine to medium sand mixtures prepared in various gradations. Finally, unconfined compression strength (UCS) and falling-head permeability tests were performed on the samples that were successful in the grout test at different time intervals. With the addition of silica fume to superfine cement, the initial and final setting times as well as viscosity values increased, whereas bleeding values decreased. With the addition of silica fume to the superfine cement, the groutability slightly decreased, but the grouting pressure values increased. With the addition of silica fume to superfine cement, UCS values increased, although the permeability values decreased. Sand samples grouted with a superfine-cement suspension with silica fume additive gained strength later than sand samples grouted with superfine-cement suspensions with no additive. Experimental studies have shown that the addition of silica fume to superfine cement improves the engineering properties of the grouted sands.

The results suggest that the intrinsic scatter in the fatigue life could be partially explained by the essential scatter in the fiber orientation and content. On the contrary, no relationship is observed between the intrinsic scatter in compressive strength and fiber orientation and content, which suggests that the compressive strength of the specimens is mainly due to their concrete matrix.

Asphalt mixtures are composite materials. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse the relationship between the microstructural characteristics and the mechanical performance of asphalt mixtures at different DoCs. In this paper, the 3D microstructures of the asphalt specimens were reconstructed by means of Digital Image Processing (DIP) techniques based on X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) scanning. Results from the Indirect Tensile Test (ITT) were used to determine the tensile strength of the asphalt specimens. The results show that the relationships between the DoC and the tensile strength as well as the fracture energy are not linear for asphalt specimens at the same testing temperature. This indicates the occurrence of over-compaction during the compaction process. In order to reveal the mechanism of the over compaction at the microscale, the 3D fractal dimension of air voids and aggregates were derived. The 3D fractal dimension of the air voids is variable and constant at first and then becomes smaller during the compaction process. The complexity of the air void morphology is related to the tensile strengths and a hypothesis based on the evolution of 3D fractal dimension of the air voids is proposed in this paper to explain this phenomenon. The results of this research help to increase the understanding regarding the mechanism of over compaction based on the microstructure of the asphalt specimens. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Various statistical and machine learning techniques are examined in the past for fault prediction. In this study, we have performed an empirical analysis of object-oriented (OO) metrics with a review of studies from the year 1996 to 2018 in the literature considering the statistical and machine learning techniques for software fault prediction. In this research, the concept of factor analysis and its sub-measures with regression are used to assess the capabilities for fault-proneness. The authors have also grouped the significant predictors i.e. CK and OO metrics using the factor analysis. In this paper, we have identified significant factor's in five software's datasets. The model is using the factor analysis with regression technique for estimating software fault-proneness. The results calculated prove the potential and capabilities of factor analysis for grouping important factors and using regression to identify the significant predictors. The experimental results obtained prove the ability of factor analysis with regression for predicting the susceptibility of software towards, the grouping of the components and effective use of the concept researchers and software practitioners. However, the significance and the application of the factor analysis with regression in software fault prediction are still limited and focus on these studies should be considered in order to generalize the results. On the basis of the results obtained, researchers are provided with future guidelines in this research work.

Variogram-Based Descriptors for Comparison and Classification of Rock Texture Images	MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES			English	Article; Early Access						Rock texture discrimination; Geo-metallurgy characterization; Variogram-based features; Compact representation; Comparison metrics	QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT; FEATURES; STRENGTH; SCALE	Rock characterization is typically performed by geologists in mining companies and involves the analysis of several meters of drill-hole samples to describe distinctive geological properties. In this procedure, rock texture is not typically taken into account despite its importance given its close relation with metallurgical responses and, therefore, all mineral processes. To support the work of geology experts, this research seeks to obtain rock texture information, discriminating it from digital images through image processing and machine learning techniques. For this purpose, a geologist-labeled digital photograph database was used with different rock texture classes (including geological textures and structures) from drill-hole samples. To characterize rock texture, three texture descriptors based on variographic information are proposed, which summarize data contained in the image pixels, focusing on local structural patterns that numerically describe its texture properties. Then, based on a methodology of image texture comparison, which could be extended to classify different types of rock texture classes, a quantification of the system's performance was obtained. The results showed a high discrimination among common texture classes using compact variogram-based features that outperformed previous methods applied on the same rock texture database.

Currently, a large quantity of roads is being constructed under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project. It is a major concern for quality of road to with stand heavy loads. For the investigation of the quality of roads, it is mandatory to evaluate the behaviour of mineral fillers addition in asphalt mastic. Fatigue cracking, thermal cracking and permanent deformation have been found a major common distress in the construction of road networks. In this study, the behaviour of mineral fillers such as stone dust, brick dust and fly ash Class F was investigated. In flexible pavements, these mineral fillers with different concentrations such as 0%, 3%, 5% and 7% were used. Rheological, Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were utilized to find out the effect of mineral fillers as doping agents in asphalt mastic. Mechanical testing was done on dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), rotational viscometer (RV), rolling thin film oven (RTFO) and pressure aging vessel (PAV). Rutting factor G*/Sin ((sic)) from DSR, dynamic viscosity (eta)) from RV, short term aging study from RTFO and long-term aging study from PAV were investigated. The micro structural investigations showed that cracks were reduced using mineral fillers which may be due to the even distributions of particles. Rheological studies of modified binders with fly ash Class F revealed best performance against rutting as compared to stone dust and brick dust. However, the addition of 7% fly ash Class F showed the improvement of 92.17% in rutting factor. In addition, the dynamic viscosity of all three mineral based mixtures were improved at 58 degrees C, 64 degrees C, 70 degrees C and 76 degrees C respectively. The current research reported the low cost, improved performance and good environmental impacts of mineral fillers in asphalt mastic. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Momoh, EO; Osofero, AI				Momoh, Emmanuel Owoichoechi; Osofero, Adelaja Israel			Behaviour of oil palm broom fibres (OPBF) reinforced concrete	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Article						Construction; Eco-friendly; Composite; Natural fibres; Oil palm broom fibres; OPBF-concrete; Physical properties; Mechanical properties; Reinforcement	NATURAL FIBER; MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE; BOND-BEHAVIOR; COMPOSITES; STRENGTH; MORPHOLOGY; TENSILE; WASTE; SISAL	Recent concerns on global environmental sustainability and climate change have favoured the use of natural fibres as alternatives to traditional reinforcing steel in concrete due to their low carbon footprint. Oil palm broom fibres (OPBF) which are the ribs of oil palm leaflets have average length, cross-sectional area, density and tensile strength of 900 mm, 1.837 mm(2), 0.84 g/cm(3) and 389 MPa respectively, hence making the fibres superior to steel in terms of strength-to-weight ratio. A study on the effect of OPBF on some mechanical properties of concrete mix of 1:1.5:3 of cement, sand and gravel respectively, was carried out. Short discrete OPBF of 50 mm length were incorporated in the fresh concrete mix at 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 3% and 4% of total aggregate volume. A total of two hundred and seventy-six (276) samples of 150 cubic, 63 cylindrical and 63 prismatic specimens were cast to assess compressive strength of OPBF-concrete at 7, 14, 28, 56 and 112 days, and flexural and split-tensile strengths at 28, 56 and 112 days. Bond strength between OPBF and concrete matrix was also investigated through pull-out tests. Flexural strength and splitting tensile strength of concrete were slightly improved for 0.5-1% OPBF inclusion at 28 days but do not show marked improvements at 112 days. Failure of hardened OPBF-concrete was characterised by more fibre-pull-outs than fibre-fracture but with an enhanced ductility of the composite at failure.

This limitation is due to the highly nonlinear relation between the mortar's compressive strength and the mixed components. In this paper, the application of artificial neural networks for predicting the compressive strength of mortars has been investigated. Specifically, surrogate models (such as artificial neural network models) have been used for the prediction of the compressive strength of mortars (based on experimental data available in the literature). Furthermore, compressive strength maps are presented for the first time, aiming to facilitate mortar mix design. The comparison of the derived results with the experimental findings demonstrates the ability of artificial neural networks to approximate the compressive strength of mortars in a reliable and robust manner.

However, this technology often faces reliability problems due to structural vibration. This study proposes a smart semi-active vibration control system using Magnetorheological (MR) dampers where feedback controllers are optimized with nature-inspired algorithms. Proportional integral derivative (PID) and Proportional integral (PI) controllers are designed to achieve the optimal desired force and current input for MR the damper. PID control parameters are optimized using an Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. The effectiveness of the ACO algorithm is validated by comparing its performance with Ziegler-Nichols (Z-N) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The placement of the MR damper on the tower is also investigated to ensure structural balance and optimal desired force from the MR damper. The simulation results show that the proposed semi-active PID-ACO control strategy can significantly reduce vibration on the wind turbine tower under different frequencies (i.e., 67%, 73%, 79% and 34.4% at 2 Hz, 3 Hz, 4.6 Hz and 6 Hz, respectively) and amplitudes (i.e. 50%, 58% and 67% for 50 N, 80 N, and 100 N, respectively). In this study, the simulation model is validated with an experimental study in terms of natural frequency, mode shape and uncontrolled response at the 1st mode. The proposed PID-ACO control strategy and optimal MR damper position is also implemented on a lab-scaled wind turbine tower model. The results show that the vibration reduction rate is 66% and 73% in the experimental and simulation study, respectively, at the 1st mode.

In the course of the development of a variety of material types, a validation for technical utilization is of great interest. For that reason, standardized samples in three different layer orientations, made of 16 different filament materials, were FDM-printed and tensile tested at room temperature in order to determine their mechanical behavior. Besides the usual plastic types for FDM-printing, such as PLA, ABS or PETG, compound filaments from the four categories metal, carbon, wood, and stone were examined. Carbon showed for any technical applications the most practical results, since the particles increase overall strength and simultaneously contribute to reduced weight. The other composite materials too, for environmental and eco-friendly reasons, are still of interest, although tests have shown that no significant change in resilience has occurred. Moreover, it is found that a crosswise printing direction leads to the best results.

The indirect tensile test (IDT) is widely used to characterise the fracture resistance in terms of tensile strengths of the asphalt mixtures. This paper presents an optimised method for two-dimensional (2D) finite element (FE) modelling of the IDT to simulate crack initiation and propagation within the asphalt mixtures on the microscale. X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) scanning and digital image processing (DIP) techniques were applied to detect and reconstruct the microstructure of asphalt specimens. Cohesive zone modeling (CZM) techniques were applied in the FE simulations to represent the fracture behaviour. The procedure of the FE modelling and parameter optimisation are described comprehensively. Four important parameters governing the numerical solutions during the simulation process were optimised based on counts of accuracy as well as computational efficiency. The optimised models were also validated based on experimental results. As a case study, the influence of the loading orientation on the fracture behaviour of asphalt mixtures was investigated. The validation and case study prove the reliability and applicability of the proposed FE modelling algorithm; further improvements will be carried out to facilitate the development of the pavement design process.

Optimal Pendulum Tuned Mass Damper Design Applied to High Towers Using Genetic Algorithms: Two-DOF Modeling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL STABILITY AND DYNAMICS			English	Article						Passive control; tower; pendulum; tuned mass damper; optimization; genetic algorithm	STRUCTURAL CONTROL; OPTIMIZATION; VIBRATIONS; BUILDINGS	High and slender towers may experience excessive vibrations caused by both wind and seismic loads. To avoid excessive vibrations in towers, tuned mass dampers (TMDs) are often used as passive control devices due to their low cost. The TMDs can absorb part of the energy of vibration transmitted from the main structure. These devices need to be finely tuned in order to work as efficient dampers; otherwise, they can adversely amplify structural vibrations. This paper presents the optimal parameters of a pendulum TMD (PTMD) to control the vibrations of slender towers subjected to an external random force. The tower is modeled as a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) mass-spring system via an assumed-mode procedure with a pendulum attached. A genetic algorithm (GA) toolbox developed by the authors is used to find the optimal parameters of the PTMD, such as the support flexural stiffness/damping, the mass ratio and the pendulum length. The chosen fitness function searches for a minimization of the maximum frequency peaks. The results are compared with a sensibility map that contains the information of the maximum amplitude as a function of the pendulum length and the mass ratio between the pendulum and the tower. The optimal parameters can be expressed as a power-law function of the supporting flexural stiffness. In addition, a parametric analysis and a time-history verification are performed for several combinations of mass ratio and pendulum length.	[Colherinhas, Gino B.; de Morais, Marcus V.

The results indicate that the vertical deformation of the ground and the lateral deformation of the soldier pile caused by the excavation of a long and deep foundation pit in collapsible loess increase with time. The maximum surface subsidence decreases with the increase in stiffness (K) of the foundation pit support system, increases linearly with the excavation depth (H-w), and decreases with the increase in the aspect ratio of the foundation pit. The lateral maximum deformation value of the soldier pile decreases linearly with the increase in insertion ratio and decreases with the increase in K of the support system. The surface subsidence of the foundation pit is characterized by a "groove shape", and the deformation of the soldier pile is characterized as the "medium convex". These results can provide a reference for the design and construction of similar projects in loess areas, and can predict and evaluate the deformation size and safety of similar projects, which is of great significance for further understanding the deformation mechanism of deep foundation pits in loess areas, thus perfecting the design theory and preventing foundation pit accidents.

Its important performance indexes, including workability, setting and hardening time, and mechanical properties, can be optimized by materials selection and printing parameters. To date, many building structures have been successfully printed using 3D printed concrete technology, some of which have even achieved its real applications. The 3D printed concrete has a great potential on practical applications, such as the affordable housing construction in low-income countries, military bunkers when the soldiers fighting in the wild, and complex constructions where the formwork is difficult to manufacture. In order to comprehensively introduce 3D printed concrete, this paper reviews the progress of 3D printed concrete in terms of workability, mechanical properties and building plan design. In addition, the current applications and further developments of 3D printed concrete are also discussed.

One of these technologies used in the protection of structures is the semi-active control using a Magneto Rheological Damper device. But this device need an adequate controller with a robust algorithm of current or tension adjustment to operate which is further discussed in the following of this paper. In this study, a neural network controller is proposed to control the MR damper to eliminate vibrations of 3-story scaled structure exposed to Tohoku 2011 and Boumerdes 2003 earthquakes. The proposed controller is derived from a linear quadratic controller designed to control an MR damper installed in the first floor of the structure. Equipped with a feedback law the proposed control is coupled to a clipped optimal algorithm to adapt the current tension required to the MR damper adjustment. To evaluate the performance control of the proposed design controller, two numerical simulations of the controlled structure and uncontrolled structure are illustrated and compared.

Hence, developing precise tools for predicting drift capacities of reinforced concrete (RC) columns is of great interest. RC columns are not only frequently constructed, but also their composite behavior makes the capacity prediction a task faced with many uncertainties. In the current article, novel empirical approaches are presented for predicting flexural, shear and axial failure modes in RC columns. To this aim, an extensive experimental database was created by collecting outcomes of previously conducted experimental tests since 1964, which are available in the literature. It serves as the basis for deriving the equations for predicting the drift capacity of RC columns by different regression analyses (both linear with different orders and nonlinear). Furthermore, fragility curves are determined for comparing the obtained results with the experimental results and with previously proposed models, like the ones of ASCE/SEI 41-13. It is demonstrated that the proposed equations predict drift capacities, which are in better agreement with experimental results than those computed by previously published models. In addition, the reliability of the proposed equations is higher from a probabilistic point of view.

Many studies have reported the influences of fiber percentage on the shear strength of fiber reinforced soil. However, different natural fibers perform differently in the soil reinforcement because of their different physical and chemical properties. In this study, the physical and chemical properties of natural fibers (i.e., natural moisture content, specific gravity, breaking tensile strength, breaking strain, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and ash) were examined for their influences in the soil reinforcement. Experimental data of unconfined compressive strength (UCS) for three types of natural fibers (coir, jute, and water hyacinth) were collected from the literature. A total of 11 factors including soil moisture content, soil density, and fiber percentage were evaluated by using the Bayesian nonparametric general regression (BNGR) method. The robustness of the BNGR algorithm was validated using k-fold cross-validation. A parametric study was carried out to unveil the effects of these input variables. The results indicated that a higher fiber percentage or larger soil density induces higher reinforcement effect. Besides, the cellulose in a natural fiber is found to have a significant effect on the UCS, followed by the ash, whereas the other chemical components, i.e., hemicellulose and lignin, have less association with soil reinforcement. With respect to the physical properties, the breaking strain is found to be highly correlated with the UCS, whereas the effects of fiber natural moisture content, specific gravity, and breaking tensile strength are less significant parameters.

In this study, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) models were used to determine cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate in arid areas in Iran. The input data were sand, clay, silt, density of soil and soil moisture, while the output data were cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate, the latter measured using a double-ring infiltrometer at 16 locations. The results show that SVM with radial basis kernel function better estimated cumulative infiltration (RMSE = 0.2791 cm) compared to the other models. Also, SVM with M4 radial basis kernel function better estimated the infiltration rate (RMSE = 0.0633 cm/h) than the ANFIS and RF models. Thus, SVM was found to be the most suitable model for modelling infiltration in the study area.

The geometry of the interfering footings with respect to their width is considered to be asymmetric. The analyses have been carried out using finite element software ABAQUS following the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion obeying non-associated flow rule for foundation medium. The interference effect on the characteristic behaviour of the footing such as load-settlement (p-delta) behaviour, ultimate bearing capacity (UBC) and settlement have been evaluated. The UBC and settlement have been represented in terms of non-dimensional interaction factors defined as the ratio of UBC/settlement of left/right footing in presence of adjacent footing to that of the same considered for an isolated footing under identical condition. The results of the analyses reveal that the interaction factors with respect to UBC (xi(L)/xi(R)) and settlement (zeta(L)/zeta(R)) are affected significantly by the variation of clear spacing between the footings, embedment depth, soil friction angle and the width of adjacent footings. The interference effect is more prominent in the case of smaller footing having lesser embedment depth on the soil with higher friction angle in comparison with the footing of larger dimension.

In this study, long-term performance tests of styrene-butadiene-styrene- (SBS)-modified asphalt mixtures are designed and evaluated with different blending ratios of the cement-mineral powder under three aging conditions. Moreover, the effect of the cement-mineral composite filler on long-term performance of the asphalt mixture using different blending ratios is determined. Cement improves the high-temperature performance and water stability of asphalt mixtures, but only for certain aging conditions. Considering the regulations for the road performance of asphalt mixtures for three aging conditions, as well as long-term performance considerations, the results indicated that the mass ratio of Portland cement to mineral powder must not exceed 2:2. Low-temperature bending and splitting tensile tests confirmed that an excessive amount of cement filler will embrittle the modified asphalt mixture during long-term aging, thereby deteriorating the tensile properties. The mechanism by which the filler influences the performance of the asphalt mixture should be further studied from the perspective of microscopic and molecular dynamics.

With the aim to realize both buildings and civil works without using any molding, not only has the need for reliable mechanical properties of printed concrete grown, but also the need for more durable and environmentally friendly materials. As a consequence of super positioning cementitious layers, voids are created which can negatively affect durability. This paper presents the results of an experimental study on the relationship between 3DCP process parameters and the formed microstructure. The effect of two different process parameters (printing speed and inter-layer time) on the microstructure was established for fresh and hardened states, and the results were correlated with mechanical performance. In the case of a higher printing speed, a lower surface roughness was created due to the higher kinetic energy of the sand particles and the higher force applied. Microstructural investigations revealed that the amount of unhydrated cement particles was higher in the case of a lower inter-layer interval (i.e., 10 min). This phenomenon could be related to the higher water demand of the printed layer in order to rebuild the early Calcium-Silicate-Hydrate (CSH) bridges and the lower amount of water available for further hydration. The number of pores and the pore distribution were also more pronounced in the case of lower time intervals. Increasing the inter-layer time interval or the printing speed both lowered the mechanical performance of the printed specimens. This study emphasizes that individual process parameters will affect not only the structural behavior of the material, but they will also affect the durability and consequently the resistance against aggressive chemical substances.

In order to improve its crack resistance properties in the process of freeze-thaw cycles, P.O 42.5 ordinary Portland cement was added to form a mixture called cement improved aeolian sand (CIAS). SEM was used to analyze the microscopic micro-structure of CIAS at different times (7 days and 28 days). The mechanical properties of CIAS samples affected by freeze-thaw cycles were tested in a triaxial instrument, and gray-scale images of the three-phase distribution in the CIAS after freeze-thaw cycling were obtained by computed tomography (CT) scanning technology. The pore characteristic parameters (pore area, fractal dimension, and crack length) were studied by digital image process technique. Based on classical Griffith fracture theory, the development of the crack length and crack width with increasing freeze-thaw cycles is determined. Assuming that the pore area subordinates to the Weibull distribution, the parameters of the Weibull distribution, the damage evolution defined by the elastic modulus attenuation, and the pore area development of CIAS were determined. Research shows the cohesion decreases and internal friction angle increases with increasing cycle numbers. Three development patterns are observed: crack growth, crack closure, and crack merging, and the three patterns interact during freeze-thaw cycling. Furthermore, the fractal dimension of the pore edge fluctuates with the increasing number of freeze-thaw cycles. This work provides a theoretical basis for the application of aeolian sand and develops a method for disaster prevention in applications of freeze-thaw cycling.

Conventional geophones have problems such as a narrow spectral width, low sensitivity, and poor coupling with the tunnel wall. To tackle issues above, we propose a semi-automatic coupling geophone equipped with a piezoelectric sensor with a spectral range of 10-5000 Hz and a sensitivity of 2.8 V/g. After the geophone was manually pushed into the borehole, it automatically coupled with the tunnel wall under the pressure of the springs within the device. A comparative experiment showed that the data spectrum acquired by the semi-automatic coupling geophone was much higher than that of the conventional geophone equipped with the same piezoelectric sensor. The seismic data were processed in combination with forward modeling. The imaging results also show that the data acquired by the semi-automatic coupling geophone were more in line with the actual geological conditions. In addition, the semi-automatic coupling geophone's installation requires a lower amount of time and cost. In summary, the semi-automatic coupling geophone is able to efficiently acquire seismic data with high fidelity, which can provide a reference for tunnel construction safety.

The inputs to the ANN were curing days and percentage bamboo content in the bamboo reinforced concrete material, while the outputs were cost, flexural and tensile strength. The ANN predicted the experimentally determined values of the tensile strength, flexural strength and costs of the bamboo reinforced concrete material excellently with correlation coefficients of 0.99635, 0.99739 and 1, respectively. Subsequently, the ANN was used as the fitness function for NSGA-II for multi-objective optimization of the cost, flexural and tensile strength of bamboo reinforced concrete material. The Pareto optimal solution obtained could serve as a design guide for engineers for optimal design of structures using cost, flexural and tensile strength of bamboo reinforced concrete material.

Traditionally, accelerated wear and abrasion machines do not account for slip rates and variable motion directions. Therefore, a laboratory-scale, multi-variable accelerated abrasion machine (MAAM) was developed to address these two limitations. In order to verify the device's capabilities and determine the appropriate test duration, an investigation of pavement texture deterioration was conducted. The indexes of deterioration (polishing wear) for representative road surfaces included Mean Profile Depth (MPD) and variances in both macro-texture and micro-texture. Results indicated that MPD and elevation variances of both macro-texture and micro-texture decreased significantly at first and then decreased slowly to reach a stable value by the end of the test. Results also suggest that the polishing effect was significant on the basis of MPD statistical analysis, texture appearance and tactile feel of the worn surfaces. As a result of this investigation, the MAAM is proposed for use as a practical laboratory tool to obtain information on pavement texture disintegration.

Hence, establishing an accurate predictive for quantifying some beam-column joint characteristics is highly essential for structural engineering aspects. The current study is performed to predict load-carrying capacity (P-max) and mode failure of beam-column joint concrete using newly data intelligence model called extreme learning machine (ELM) model. 153 experimental data are gathered from the literature to construct the predictive model for training and testing phases. The input attributes consisted various dimensional information belong to the beam-column joint and concrete specification, are formed to be supplied for the predictive model. The proposed self-tuning predictive model validated against one of the prevalent regression model namely multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) model. The results evidenced that ELM model attained reliable prediction performance in comparison with MARS model. Statistical evaluation reported ELM and MARS models attained minimal root mean square error (RMSE approximate to 14.44 and 18.63), respectively. Accuracy of beam failure (BF) and joint failure (JF) predictions attained for ELM approximate to 0.78 and MARS approximate to 0.73.

In this research, a microfine-cement-based grout mixed with microfine fly ash (MFA), nano-CaCO3 (NC), and superplasticizer (SP) was designed to improve the rheological and mechanical properties of grouting materials, and the particle size distribution, fluidity, spreading ability, bleed capacity, setting time, and mechanical properties were studied. A water/solid (W/S) ratio of 1.2 was selected, and the contents of MFA, NC, and SP by mass of microfine cement (MC) were 0-40%, 0-2.0%, and 1.5%, respectively. The results showed that MFA and 1.5% SP improved the fluidity and spreading ability of fresh grouts, while prolonging the setting time. The addition of NC can increase the yield stress and plastic viscosity and decrease the fluidity and spreading ability; nevertheless, it obviously enhances the stability and shortens the setting time of grouts. The addition of MFA and 1.5% SP reduced the compressive strength of hardened grouts; however, the addition of NC improved the mechanical properties.

Asphalt compaction operations in the field are mostly based on the experience of field staff. Hence, independent of the actual temperature of the HMA. In this study, temperature variation in hot mix asphalt (HMA) was investigated during paving operations at eight test locations in field. Two most commonly used HMA layer thicknesses i.e. 5 cm and 8 cm were studied. Temperature of the fresh HMA layer was noted at the centre, surface and at the interface points by four node K-type thermocouple assembly. The average laying temperature of the HMA for eight tests was calculated as 136.92 degrees C. Whereas, the average compaction start temperature for eight tests was noted as 127.81 degrees C which shows the critical temperature loss of 9.11 degrees C before the compaction starts. The average compaction end temperature calculated was 62.89 degrees C which is below the common cut off temperature of 80 degrees C. Temperature difference between day and night tests was 10 degrees C which can be attributed as the effect of sunlight. The results of this study can be helpful to the field staff in decision making during paving operations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yi, SR; Wang, ZQ; Song, J				Yi, Sang-ri; Wang, Ziqi; Song, Junho			Gaussian mixture-based equivalent linearization method (GM-ELM) for fragility analysis of structures under nonstationary excitations	EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING & STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS			English	Article						equivalent linearization; fragility analysis; Gaussian mixture; nonlinear stochastic analysis; nonstationary excitations; random vibrations; seismic analysis	RANDOM VIBRATION; SYSTEMS; PROBABILITY; RELIABILITY; EARTHQUAKE	Gaussian mixture-based equivalent linearization method (GM-ELM) is a recently developed stochastic dynamic analysis approach which approximates the random response of a nonlinear structure by collective responses of equivalent linear oscillators. The Gaussian mixture model is employed to achieve an equivalence in terms of the probability density function (PDF) through the superposition of the response PDFs of the equivalent linear system. This new concept of linearization helps achieve a high level of estimation accuracy for nonlinear responses, but has revealed some limitations: (1) dependency of the equivalent linear systems on ground motion intensity and (2) requirements for stationary condition. To overcome these technical challenges and promote applications of GM-ELM to earthquake engineering practice, an efficient GM-ELM-based fragility analysis method is proposed for nonstationary excitations. To this end, this paper develops the concept of universal equivalent linear system that can estimate the stochastic responses for a range of seismic intensities through an intensity-augmented version of GM-ELM. Moreover, the GM-ELM framework is extended to identify equivalent linear oscillators that could capture the temporal average behavior of nonstationary responses. The proposed extensions generalize expressions and philosophies of the existing response combination formulations of GM-ELM to facilitate efficient fragility analysis for nonstationary excitations. The proposed methods are demonstrated by numerical examples using realistic ground motions, including design code-conforming nonstationary ground motions.

Full-depth reclamation with cement as a binder is closely linked to the concept of sustainability. In addition to the environmental benefits of reusing the existing pavement as aggregate, this practice entails significant technical and economic advantages. In Spain, in the absence of tests specifically designed to determine the behavior of recycled pavements stabilized with cement, these materials are treated as soil-cement or cement-bound granular material. This assumption is not entirely accurate, because this recycled pavement contains some bituminous elements that reduce its stiffness. This study aimed to obtain the relationships between flexural strength (FS) and the parameters that describe the pavement behavior (long-term unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and indirect tensile strength (ITS)) and compare the findings with the relationships between these parameters in soil-cement and cement-bound granular materials. The results showed that the similar behavior hypothesis is not entirely accurate for recycled pavements stabilized with cement, because they have lower strength values-although, this is not necessarily an indication of poorer performance.

Electric arc furnace (EAF) slags are those wastes deriving from secondary steelmaking production; these slags can be re-used and recycled in many industrial applications such as the production of asphalt mixes. In this paper authors investigate the surface performance of EAF slags used as second-hand aggregate in asphalt mixes. In particular, slags behavior under polishing is compared to other types of aggregate commonly used for asphalt concrete such as limestone, basalt, and kinginzite. Several devices (skid tester, laser profilometer, polishing machine) were used to collect experimental data; the analysis of microtexture was carried out by comparing aggregate surface performance before and after polishing. Results show that EAF slags are positively comparable to basalt as concerns the polishing behavior; good correlations between skid resistance and some microtexture indicators are also carried out.

The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model was generated using valid experimental data with seven input variables. Input parameters were considered in such a way that all the parameters affecting the compressive strength of the column were simultaneously involved. Different models for compressive strength of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP)-confined concrete including the model in American Concrete Institute (ACI), to calculate the maximum stress endured by the column under axial load, were presented and compared with the results of the ANFIS model. Also, for similarity to other models, the ACI equation for calculating the maximum compressive strength tolerated by a column was considered without reducing coefficients as ACI-N and was compared with other models. The results obtained from the ANFIS model were compared with results from other models. ANFIS model showed the highest accuracy among all models in predicting the experimental results.

Especially the tunnel goes through the fault fracture zone. This paper sets forth the process of the collapse that occurred in the Yezhuping Tunnel affected by the fault fracture zone and introduces the treatment for the collapse. The deformation characteristics of the surrounding rock are analyzed according to the monitoring results. Based on the research regarding the effect of the fault on the tunnel by using the general Hoek-Brown failure criterion and the field monitoring results, it is shown that the fault is the main reason for the collapse; it induces the attenuation of the Young modulus and the compressive strength and the enlargement of the plastic zone. The research results have some reference significance for similar projects.

Crack, rutting, roughness, and other miscellaneous distresses of fiber-grid-reinforced overlay sections and ordinary overlay sections were compared. Pavement conditions of fiber grid overlay sections before and after the overlay were also compared. Cores were obtained from the fiber-grid-reinforced and ordinary sections to measure bonding shear strength between the intermediate and overlay layers. Fracture energy, displacement after yield, and shear stiffness of the cores were also obtained by analyzing the test results. Finite element analysis was performed by using the test results to validate the effect of the fiber grid reinforcement on the long-term performance of asphalt overlay pavements. Rutting and fatigue cracking were predicted for three cases: 1) fiber grid was not used; 2) glass fiber grid was used; and 3) carbon fiber grid was used. The cracking ratio of fiber-grid-reinforced sections was much smaller than that of ordinary sections. The results of field investigation, laboratory test, and finite element analysis showed that the fiber grid reinforcement improved the long-term performance of asphalt overlay pavements.

For design and quality control of the final product in FDR method, the unconfined compressive strength of stabilized material should be known. This paper aims to develop a mathematical model for predicting the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of soil-RAP blend stabilized with Portland cement based on multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS). To this end, two different aggregate materials were mixed with different percentages of RAP and then stabilized by different percentages of Portland cement. For training and testing of MARS model, total of 64 experimental UCS data were employed. Predictors or independent variables in the developed model are percentage of RAP, percentage of cement, optimum moisture content, percent passing of #200 sieve, and curing time. The results demonstrate that MARS has a great ability for prediction of the UCS in case of soil-RAP blend stabilized with Portland cement (R-2 is more than 0.97). Sensitivity analysis of the proposed model showed that the cement, optimum moisture content, and percent passing of #200 sieve are the most influential parameters on the UCS of FDR layer.

Furthermore, a new approach for taking into account the uncertainties associated with the steel shear buildings is proposed. In the proposed approach, the probabilistic distributions of the stiffness and yield properties of stories of a set of reference steel moment frame structures are derived through Monte-Carlo sampling. The approach is applied to steel shear buildings isolated with LRB systems. The base isolation systems are designed for different target base displacements by minimizing a relative performance index using Genetic Algorithm. Thereafter, the base-isolated structures are equipped with TLDs and a combination of the base and TLD properties is sought by which the maximum reduction occurs in the base displacement without compromising the performance of the system. In addition, the effects of TLD properties on the performance of the system are studied through a parametric study. Based on the analyses results, the base displacement can be reduced 23% by average, however, the maximum reduction can go beyond 30%.

Five different contents of tire derived aggregates (TDA) were mixed with sand thoroughly to ensure homogeneity. A series of large scale oedometer experiments were conducted to investigate the compressibility properties of the mixtures. Tire shreds content, TDA aspect ratio, skeletal relative density and overburden pressure are studied parameters. Constrained deformation modulus and coefficient of earth pressure at rest are measured parameters. All tests were conducted at seven overburden pressure levels. It was concluded that deformability of TDA-sand mixture increases with soft inclusion. Overburden pressure and skeletal relative density are also important parameters which render more rigidity and less lateral earth pressure coefficient accordingly. TDA size or aspect ratio was shown to have minor effect at least for the constrained strain conditions encountered in current study. An EPR-based parametric study and also sensitivity analyses based on cosine amplitude method revealed quantitative evaluation of the relative importance of each input parameter in varying deformation and lateral earth pressure coefficient as the outputs.

GP, M5P and ANN models were providing a good estimate of performance, whereas the RF model outperforms them. For this study, a dataset containing 52 observations obtained from the laboratory experiments. Total data set (52 observations) has been segregated in two different groups. The larger group (36) was used for model development and the smaller group (16) was used for testing the models. Input dataset consists of dispersive soil (%), cement clinker (%), fly ash (%) and curing time (days), whereas unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of soil (MPa) was taken as a target. Sensitivity testing results conclude that the curing time is the most essential factor in estimating the strength of dispersive soil with cement clinker and fly ash for RF-based modelling. The results of this study also suggest that the combined mix of cement clinker and fly ash are used to increase the UCS of dispersive soil than an alone mix.

Real-time locating and tracking technologies are getting widely used for automated monitoring of the location and direction of onsite resources, specifically workers and equipment in order to prevent hazard exposures and potential accidents. Despite the importance of utilizing real-time locating systems (RTLS) for better site safety, research on this area has been ubiquitous and a systematic review which directly addresses the association between RTLSs and construction safety is lacking. This study aims to conduct a systematic literature review to investigate predominant research streams, achievements, and limitations to the all existing applications of RTLS technology in construction safety management, and suggest potential areas for future research on the integration of RTLS applications into wider scopes of onsite safety management. The main contribution of this review lies on providing a more comprehensive knowledge of the current utilization and further development of RTLS applications on improving construction safety management. RTLSs have aided safety management process in eight major research streams including safety monitoring, accident prevention, behavior-based safety, safety alerts and warnings, ergonomics analysis and physiological status monitoring, communication-based safety, performance evaluation of the developed RTLS-related technologies and on-site safety training. However, there are limitations and gaps in applying each particular application which are highlighted to clarify the future research avenues.

Residual capacity of cold-formed steel rack uprights following stomping during rocking	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH			English	Article						Cold-formed steel upright; Earthquake recovery; Residual capacity; Rocking; Stomping		When selective pallet racks are allowed to rock in the cross-aisle direction during an earthquake, the uprights are subjected to short duration high axial forces at stomping. In this paper, the amplitude of the stomping force needed to compromise the upright's residual capacity is assessed for 59 configurations using nonlinear inelastic static and dynamic analyses. Parametric studies are performed to investigate the effects of upright length, bracing pitch, section slenderness, torsional restraints and multiple impulses on the residual capacity of an upright due to rocking. Uprights that fail in the flexural-torsional buckling mode perform better than those that fail by local-distortional buckling as the stomping causes permanent local-distortional deformations rather than sweep (torsional deformation). A rack upright that has a greater length, greater thickness and lower torsional restraint tends to have a higher residual capacity (relative to the undamaged capacity). A typical cold-formed steel rack upright can sustain a 0.1 s stomping force that is at least 15% greater than its static ultimate capacity without significant reduction in residual capacity. An implication is that an unanchored upright that survives an earthquake through rocking may double its storage load during the post-earthquake emergency period. The present shell element analysis results can be used to plan an experimental program for optimising the resilience of storage rack uprights against stomping.

J	Zhang, DR; Birgisson, B; Luo, X; Onifade, I				Zhang, Derun; Birgisson, Bjorn; Luo, Xue; Onifade, Ibrahim			A new short-term aging model for asphalt binders based on rheological activation energy	MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						Short-term aging; Viscosity; Rheological activation energy; Asphalt binder	FATIGUE CRACKING PERFORMANCE; TEMPERATURE; PREDICTION; BEHAVIOR	Short-term aging of asphalt binders is an inevitable phenomenon during mix production and laydown that significantly affects the rheological properties of asphalt binders and further contributes to the deterioration of pavement performance. This paper presents a new short-term aging model for asphalt binders. The new model focuses on the binder viscosity as the target property and incorporates the rheological activation energy for the model development. It consists of four model coefficients and two essential binder specific inputs (i.e. viscosity and rheological activation energy of the unaged asphalt binder). The rheological activation energy is calculated from the conventional properties of unaged asphalt binders like penetration, kinematic viscosity, and absolute viscosity measured at various temperatures or from the known Viscosity Temperature Susceptibility parameters (i.e. A-VTS values) of unaged asphalt binders. The global model coefficients are determined using data extracted from the long-term pavement performance database. The short-term aging is verified to increase the rheological activation energy of the asphalt binder to a certain amount which is linearly proportional to that of the unaged binder. It is also found that the new model delivers more accurate viscosity prediction capabilities over the existing binder aging model. The new model is then validated through data collected from multiple independent data sources. The validation results indicate that the new model provides fairly accurate predictions in both laboratory and field short-term aging. Thus, it can be concluded that the new model is a good candidate for the short-term aging prediction.

This paper extended the traditional block theory to tunnels constructed using tunnel boring machine (TBM) by incorporating the disc cutter-block interaction mechanism. The rock blocks were divided into front, corner and rear blocks according to their spatial positions with respect to the cutterhead. The interaction between different blocks and the disc cutters mounted on the cutterhead were examined by estimating the forces exerted by disc cutters on the blocks relative to the location of the blocks in the face, direction of movement of the discs, and the depth of penetration. The estimated forces were then used in a subsequent analysis to calculate factor of safety for individual blocks and probability of blocks dislodging from its location. Two new evaluation parameters, e(A) and e(eta), were proposed to account for the probability of block instability. e(A) is the ratio of exposed area of unstable blocks to the face area and quantifies the size of unstable blocks relative to the face, and e(eta) is the ratio of cutterhead rotation angles making a block unstable to the total rotation angles in a revolution which reflects the possibility of encountering an unstable block during a single round of revolution. This paper discussed the implementation of the idea of using fundamental concepts of block theory to determine block stability at the face and related analysis for assessment of face stability. The proposed method was used in evaluation of the stability conditions for a water-conveyance tunnel in western China that is currently under construction using a hard rock TBM.

In this paper, the rheological and mechanical properties of grouts with different additives were investigated. The results show that all microfine-cement-based grouts have satisfactory apparent viscosity, behave as Bingham fluids, are stable for water/solid (W/S) ratio = 1.2. The incorporation of MFA and SP each improve the fluidity and spreading ability of fresh grouts, while prolonging the setting time. The addition of NS has negative effects on fluidity and shrinkage property of fresh grouts, nevertheless, it has positive effects on shortening setting time, enhancing stability and mechanical properties.

The interfering footings are of identical size (B). Varying the clear spacing (S) between footings, its effect on the performance of proposed footing in terms of pressure-settlement behaviour, bearing pressure/capacity and settlement aspect at permissible limit has been studied and compared with an isolated/existing footing and with interfering footings loaded simultaneously. Further, the effect of proposed footing on the performance of existing footing has been explored. The results highlight the interference has a significant effect on the bearing pressure/capacity and settlement aspect of the proposed footing and the behaviour is asymmetrical in comparison with the footings loaded simultaneously. The bearing pressure/capacity and settlement at the permissible limit are at their peak at a certain S/B ratio. For footings on dense sand, the interference effect is significant on bearing pressure/capacity aspect, whereas on settlement aspect for footings on loose sand. The overall effect is significant for S/B <= 6.0 for footings on dense cohesionless soil bed.

Prefabrication is a promising method to alleviate issues related to housing shortage and affordability by reducing material wastage, construction delays, weather impacts, unexpected costs, skilled labour dependence and construction risks. The full potential of prefabricated construction is yet to be realised in part due to most of developments being focused on its superstructure. Prefabricated substructures should conform with the Ultimate Limit State (i.e. strength capacity) and the Serviceability Limit State (i.e. allowable deformation and damage) stated in the Australian Standards. Due to the initiatives to alleviate issues of housing crisis, skilled labour shortage and unpredictable house damage, it is necessary to review the existing available substructures suitable for single-detached dwellings on reactive soils and to evaluate the necessary considerations and challenges in developing prefabricated substructures. This review will help understand the present state of the design and construction industry and the efforts of inventors and designers to reduce damages due to the shrinking and swelling ground movements. This review also guides product developers to design systems having robust performance without compromising practicality.

In order to understand the fracture mechanism in the freeze-thaw (F-T) damage process, the mesoscale structure of AC-13 is obtained by computed tomography (CT). The fractal dimension of cracks is used as a damage evaluation index. Most previous studies have only focused on the fractal dimensions of whole cracks, while ignoring the fractal tectonic process and the self-similarity degree of a single fracture. Therefore, in this study, the intrinsic mechanism of fractures and damage were investigated. In addition, the critical crack stress and fracture toughness models of a single fracture in a freeze-thaw damage process are established for AC-13. The results indicate that in terms of the critical crack stress and fracture toughness, with the increase of F-T times, there is an obvious decreasing trend. The fracture model can effectively describe the fracture toughness calculated by ABAQUS in the process of freeze-thaw cycles.

A set of nine performance indices is defined to evaluate the performance of the controller in the presence of uncertainties in the superstructure, lead rubber bearing (LRB) seismic isolation system, and applied loads. The time delay effect on the stability and performance of the PID controller is also examined. The results show that the PID controller is robust against the uncertainties up to +/- 15% in the damping and stiffness coefficients of the superstructure, the yield force of the LRB and the artificial earthquake. In the case with +/- 15% of uncertainty, the input energy entering into the structure is increased with respect to the nominal model. However, the changes of the performance indices related to the damage energies are negligible. An uncertainty of similar to 20% in the stiffness coefficient and stiffness ratio of the LRB gives an increase of 15% in the maximum and root mean square (RMS) of the structural responses. In the case with similar to 20% of uncertainty, the damage and damping energies do not change in comparison with the case of the nominal model, but a significant decay in the performance index related to the input energy response is obtained in this case. Not all performance indices are sensitive to time delay. For large time delays, the performance index for the seismic input energy increases significantly, while the maximum damage and damping energies increase up to 5% and 10%, respectively.

Dimensionless fragility analysis of seismic acceleration demands through low-order building models	BULLETIN OF EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Dimensional analysis; Acceleration demands; Fragility curves; Non-structural damage; Seismic response	FLOOR RESPONSE SPECTRA; STRONG-MOTION DURATION; STEEL STRUCTURES; GROUND-MOTION; EARTHQUAKE; BEHAVIOR; RECORDS; CURVES; TIME	This paper deals with the estimation of fragility functions for acceleration-sensitive components of buildings subjected to earthquake action. It considers ideally coherent pulses as well as real non-pulselike ground-motion records applied to continuous building models formed by a flexural beam and a shear beam in tandem. The study advances the idea of acceleration-based dimensionless fragility functions and describes the process of their formulation. It demonstrates that the mean period of the Fourier Spectrum, Tm, is associated with the least dispersion in the predicted dimensionless mean demand. Likewise, peak ground acceleration, PGA-, and peak ground velocity, PGV-based length scales are found to be almost equally appropriate for obtaining efficient universal' descriptions of maximum floor accelerations. Finally, this work also shows that fragility functions formulated in terms of dimensionless -terms have a superior performance in comparison with those based on conventional non-dimensionless terms (like peak or spectral acceleration values). This improved efficiency is more evident for buildings dominated by global flexural type lateral deformation over the whole intensity range and for large peak floor acceleration levels in structures with shear-governed behaviour. The suggested dimensionless fragility functions can offer a universal' description of the fragility of acceleration-sensitive components and constitute an efficient tool for a rapid seismic assessment of building contents in structures behaving at, or close to, yielding which form the biggest share in large (regional) building stock evaluations.

To understand such progressive failures in rock, a parallelized peridynamics coupled with a finite element method is utilized. Through this method, the initiation position of tensile wing cracks is observed with respect to varying inclination angles of a flaw, and then its corresponding shifting mechanism is investigated. In addition, the phenomenon of the position shifting being sensitive to various flaw shapes is discussed. Moreover, it is observed that the inclination angle of a central flaw affects the initiation position of other flaws; therefore, the initiation positions of tensile wing crack emanating from other neighboring flaws are analyzed with their angles. Following tensile wing cracks, a central tensile crack segment occurs in the bridging region between a central flaw and other neighboring flaws; the developmental patterns caused by the crack segment are discussed as well. Finally, the role a central tensile crack segment plays in the formation of crack coalescence and specimen failure is investigated in detail. The numerical results in this paper demonstrate good fidelity with established physical test results and complement them, thereby expanding the understanding of fracturing morphology in rock specimens with various flaws.

In several applicative situations, this curve is built using phenomenological numerical models which simulate complex physical phenomena. To avoid cpu-time expensive numerical models, we propose to use Gaussian process regression to build functional risk curves. An algorithm is given to provide confidence bounds due to this approximation. Two methods of global sensitivity analysis of the model random input parameters on the functional risk curve are also studied. In particular, the PLI sensitivity indices allow to understand the effect of misjudgment on the input parameters' probability density functions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A two-stage Data Envelopment Analysiswith output approach was applied to 271 mills for the data from the 2006/2007 season to the 2015/2016 season. The first stage consisted of the elaboration of two efficiency models using the total milling yield of the crop (t) and the amount of total recoverable sugars (t) as the input variables and the productions of sugar (t) and ethanol (m(3)) as the output. The second stage identified the production process variables significantly influencing the efficiency through multiple linear regression. In addition, with the help of sugarcane experts, ten variables related to the efficiencies of the agricultural and industrial processes of sugar and ethanol production, which contribute to the overall productivity of the sugar-energy units, and 40 best practices were developed to observe, improve, and control these indicators in order to increase the global efficiency of the agroindustrial production units.

This paper aims to assess the transverse seismic failure mechanism and ductile properties of typical inverted Y-shape RC pylons for long span cable-stayed bridges using quasi-static model tests and numerical analyses. To facilitate the limited laboratorial loading system, a simplified displacement-controlled two-node load-pattern, one at the bifurcation-node and the other at the crossbeam, is first proposed using numerical analyses. It is found the ratio of displacements at the two loading nodes is correlated generally well with the ground motion parameter, bracketed duration. A displacement ratio of 5.0 is then adopted in the test. Test results indicate a flexural damage mode with considerable ductility: plastic hinges were detected first at bottom of the upper column (i.e., above the crossbeam), then at bottom and top of the lower column, successively; multi-level displacement ductility factors are proposed to associate with numbers of plastic hinges formed in the pylon. Moreover, an experimentally validated numerical model is adopted to study the impact of loading displacement ratios on the failure mechanism and ductility. It is found that the loading displacement ratios may significantly affect them. Smaller displacement ratios tend to transfer the location of first plastic hinge from the bottom of the upper column to that of the lower column.

Photocatalytic asphalt mixtures: semiconductors' impact in skid resistance and texture	ROAD MATERIALS AND PAVEMENT DESIGN			English	Article						photocatalytic asphalt mixtures; macrotexture; microtexture; skid resistance; optical non-contact rugometric characterisation	TIO2; OXIDATION	Photocatalytic asphalt mixtures have the capability of mitigating air quality problems and degrade oils/greases by using semiconductors. The techniques to do so can change their functional characteristics. This study aimed to analyse the functionalization effect on the essential surface characteristics, such as macrotexture, skid resistance, and microtexture. AC 14 and AC 6 mixtures were functionalised with nano-TiO2 and micro-ZnO by spraying and bulk incorporation. Mean Profile Depth, British Pendulum and microtexture amplitude parameters were evaluated. TiO2 application seemed to smooth the surface slightly. In dry condition, the skid resistance of functionalised asphalt and control mixtures was similar. In wet condition, the functionalization caused a maximum decrease of 7% in skid resistance. The amplitude parameters were not affected by any functionalization technique except the skewness of AC 14 with 6% TiO2 by bulk incorporation. Furthermore, the application of the semiconductors can be used without high impacts in texture and skid resistance.

Particular emphasis was placed on the effect of artificial microroughness of glassy and smooth surfaces of recycled materials on their final concrete strength. The concrete strength values do not show great variance, but their limited differences have been qualitatively interpreted by a new promising petrographic methodology, including the study of the surface texture of the used aggregate materials. Concretes are produced with constant volume proportions, workability, mixing, and curing conditions while using different sizes of each aggregate type. The aggregates were mixed both in dry and water saturated states in concretes.

The determination of the steel strand's integrity inside of ducts and the grouting quality are important for a strength evaluation of the structure. In this study, a capacitive sensing technique was applied to identify the cross-sectional distribution of the steel strands. The distribution was expressed in polar coordinates in an external post-tensioned pre-stressed duct model. An improved capacitive sensor structure was designed, which consisted of four electrodes, and different electrode-pairs were used to determine various locations' information of the steel strands. Two rounds of measurements were conducted using the designed sensor to detect the angle () and center distance (r) of the steel strand in the duct. The simulated and experimental results are presented and analyzed. In general, it is difficult to locate the angle of a steel strand directly from first-round capacitance measurements by analyzing the experimental results. Our method based on Q-factor analysis was presented for the position detection of a steel bar in an external post-tensioned pre-stressed duct. The center distance of the steel bar could be identified by second-round capacitance measurements. The processed results verified the effectiveness of the proposed capacitive sensor structure. Thus, the capacitive sensing technique exhibited potential for steel strand cross-section distribution detection in external post-tensioned pre-stressed ducts.

This study aims to establish a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model using radial artery pulse wave characteristic parameters to assess vascular aging. Methods: Data from 111 males and 117 females were used to propose a new method for extracting pulse wave characteristic parameters called, Equal Pressure Pulse Transit Time (EP-PTT). Firstly, 10 EP-PTTs were extracted from pulse waves which were used to describe the shape characteristics of the pulse signal. Secondly, 10 EP-PTTs were fed into MLR model, which were used to optimize the model. Lastly, the predicted age of all subjects was calculated by the optimal model. We compared the correlation coefficients of predicted age with Pulse Transit Time (PTT) and Augmentation Index (AIx) with the correlation coefficients of chronological age with PTT and AIx. Results: 9 EP-PTTs were relevant to predicting age in men and all EP-PTTs were age-related in women (P < 0.05). MLR analysis showed that EP-PTT3 and EP-PTT7 were potent predictors of vascular age in men but EP-PTT4 and EP-PTT7 were important predictors in women (P < 0.001). Comparing with the chronological age, the predicted age was closer to PTT (P < 0.001, r = -0.53 to P < 0.001, r = -0.59 in men; P < 0.001, r = -0.57 to P < 0.001, r = -0.65 in women) and AIx (P < 0.001, r = 0.64 to P < 0.001, r = 0.81 in men; P < 0.001, r = 0.51 to P < 0.001, r = 0.56 in women). Conclusions: The predicted age can better reflect vascular aging than chronological age. This proved the validity of the proposed method for assessing vascular aging.

This paper aims to determine the shear strength of steel fiber reinforced concrete beams using the application of data-intelligence models namely hybrid artificial neural network integrated with particle swarm optimization. For the considered data-intelligence models, the input matrix attribute is one of the central element in attaining accurate predictive model. Hence, various input attributes are constructed to model the shear strength as a targeted variable. The modeling is initiated using historical published researches steel fiber reinforced concrete beams information. Seven variables are used as input attribute combination including reinforcement ratio (%), concrete compressive strength (f(c)), fiber factor (F-1), volume percentage of fiber (V-f), fiber length to diameter ratio (l(f) =l(d)) effective depth (d), and shear span-to-strength ratio (a/d), while the shear strength (S-s) is the output of the matrix. The best network structure obtained using the network having ten nodes and one hidden layer. The final results obtained indicated that the hybrid predictive model of ANN-PSO can be used efficiently in the prediction of the shear strength of fiber reinforced concrete beams. In more representable details, the hybrid model attained the values of root mean square error and correlation coefficient 0.567 and 0.82, respectively.

Hydration at early age was evaluated using semi-adiabatic calorimetry and at late ages using non-evaporable water content and thermogravimetric analysis. The transport characteristic was assessed by measuring electrical resistivity. The binary paste with slag showed the highest hydration activity compared to the binary pastes with GP and fly ash (FA). The results indicated that the pozzolanic behavior of the binary paste with GP was less than that of the binary pastes with slag or FA at late ages. An increase in the electrical resistivity and compressive strength of the binary paste with GP compared to other modified pastes at late ages was observed. It was shown that GP tends to increase the drying shrinkage of the pastes. Ternary pastes containing GP did not exhibit synergistic enhancements compared to the respective binary pastes.

An elaborate bridge model was fabricated according to an assumed bridge with a total length of 2672 m and a geometric similarity ratio of 1/70. The superstructure of the bridge model consisted of a bridge girder, cables, two transition piers, four auxiliary piers and two pylons. The substructure of the model consisted of eight groups of piles embedded in synthetic soil. Accelerations, displacements and bending moments of the piles that supported the transition piers, auxiliary piers and pylons, respectively, were analyzed when the bridge was excited uniformly and nonuniformly in the transverse direction. The nonuniform excitation test was implemented by inputting the same motion to different shaking tables at different times. Three types of earthquake waves with different predominant frequencies were applied to the integral bridge model from low to high intensity. The test results indicated that distinct differences arose between the motions at the top of the pile groups supporting different parts of the superstructure despite the integral bridge model being subjected to uniform excitation. The large displacement difference between pile groups may be one of the origins of damage or even collapse of the superstructure. The amplification ratio of acceleration at the top of the pile group supporting the transition piers increased when the bridge model was excited by waves of low predominant frequency with increasing intensity. The transfer functions of accelerations (Fourier spectra of output accelerations over that of shaking table accelerations) at the top of the pile groups supporting the auxiliary piers were bimodal, which is different from the results of shaking table tests simulating the superstructure with a single degree of freedom (SDOF) system, in which only unimodal transfer functions can be obtained. The influence of the wave passage effect on the seismic response of the pile groups is detectable when the bridge model is excited longitudinally, while the influence is undetectable when the bridge model is excited transversely.

The numerical analyses were performed through the construction of three-dimensional 3D Boundary Value Problems constructed with the software Abaqus Standard. Several values for the foundation embedment and separation between footings were considered. The behavior of the granular soil was simulated through an extended Drucker-Prager constitutive model. The results were used to calibrate an extended bearing capacity equation through a multiple variable regression analysis, and accounts for the effect of the embedment depth and separation between footings. Finally, the proposed relation was compared with some reported values in the literature, including experimental tests and numerical results, and showed a better agreement with the experimental data than other reported studies.

To this end, the related dataset was collected from literature. Performance of SVM was evaluated via calculation of error indices such as coefficient of determination (R-2) and Root Mean Square of Error (RMSE). The accuracy of SVM was compared with artificial neural network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS). To find out the most effective parameters on scouring depth, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on ANN, ANFIS, and SVM. During the development of SVM, it was found that this model with R-2= 0.94 and RMSE = 0.103 in testing stage has a suitable performance for predicting the scouring depth below the river pipeline. Assessing kernel functions showed that radial basis function has the best outcomes. Comparing the accuracy of SVM with ANN and SVM showed that the accuracy of SVM is a bit better than ANN with R-2 = 0.89 and RMSE = 0.12 and ANFIS with R-2 = 0.92 and RMSE = 0.13. Sensitivity analysis showed that e/D, * and Fr are the most effective parameters for predicting the scouring depth below the pipeline.

J	Ho, CH; Martin Linares, CP				Ho, Chun-Hsing; Martin Linares, Cristina Pilar			Determining Number of Specimen Replicates in Support of Pavement Construction Using AASHTO TP 125	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING PART B-PAVEMENTS			English	Article						Asphalt mixture beams; Bending beam rheometer; Confidence intervals; Bootstrapping; Coefficient of variance	BENDING BEAM RHEOMETER; MIXTURE CREEP COMPLIANCE	The bending beam rheometer (BBR) has long been used to test low-temperature properties of asphalt binders in cold regions. More recently, a newly released TP 125 standard by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials [AASHTO. 2016. Determining the flexural creep stiffness of asphalt mixture beams using the bending beam rheometer (BBR). AASHTO TP 125. Washington, DC: AASHTO.] has been introduced to the asphalt industry to advance the testing method for the low-temperature performance of asphalt mixtures during pavement construction. This paper presents a series of statistical analyses associated with material testing to determine the number of specimen replicates in support of pavement construction using the AASHTO TP 125. Two asphalt mixtures using performance grading (PG) 64-34 and PG 58-28 binder were cut and trimmed to mixture beams in the laboratory. Statistical analyses including confidence interval, coefficient of variance (CV), bootstrapping, and randomization analysis were performed to observe the dispersed distribution of asphalt samples so as to determine the number of mixture beam replicates in order for BBR test results to be valid. Based on statistical analyses, a minimum of 5-10 specimen replicates depending on analysis purposes in the BBR test are recommended. However, highway agencies and contractors can decide the number of specimen replicates to be used as long as the CV of selected specimens is less than 0.2. To demonstrate the applicability of using asphalt mixture beams in the BBR for in situ quality control of asphalt pavements at low temperatures, two asphalt paving projects located in the western region of the United States were selected. Asphalt mixtures from each paving location were collected and tested using the BBR, and the recommended number of specimen replicates to obtain stiffness values and determine their corresponding CV was determined. Based on BBR results, there was an anomaly on a sampling location that indicated an increase in stiffness compared with the rest of the sampling locations. The paper concludes that the statistical analysis results and testing procedures presented in the paper are feasible and capable of measuring material properties (stiffness), settling a dispute, and characterizing an immediate low-temperature characteristic of constructed asphalt pavements. The methodology presented in the paper can be used by highway agencies to perform quality control activates for asphalt paving projects.

For this purpose, a total number of 57 experimental buckling tests of novel high strength steel Y-section columns were collected from the available literature to generate the dataset for training and validating the two proposed AI models. Quality assessment criteria such as coefficient of determination (R-2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used to validate and evaluate the performance of the prediction models. Results showed that both ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-PSO had a strong ability in predicting the buckling load of steel columns, but ANFIS-PSO (R-2 = 0.929, RMSE = 60.522 and MAE = 44.044) was slightly better than ANFIS-GA (R-2 = 0.916, RMSE = 65.371 and MAE = 48.588). The two models were also robust even with the presence of input variability, as investigated via Monte Carlo simulations.

In this study, we employed the spatiotemporal analysis method to measure the spatial-temporal distribution of flash floods and examined the relationship between flash floods and driving factors in different subregions of landcover. Furthermore, we analyzed the response of flash floods on the economic development by sensitivity analysis. The results indicated that the number of flash floods occurring annually increased gradually from 1949 to 2015, and regions with a high quantity of flash floods were concentrated in Zhaotong, Qujing, Kunming, Yuxi, Chuxiong, Dali, and Baoshan. Specifically, precipitation and elevation had a more significant effect on flash floods in the settlement than in other subregions, with a high r (Pearson's correlation coefficient) value of 0.675, 0.674, 0.593, 0.519, and 0.395 for the 10 min precipitation in 20-year return period, elevation, 60 min precipitation in 20-year return period, 24 h precipitation in 20-year return period, and 6 h precipitation in 20-year return period, respectively. The sensitivity analysis showed that the Kunming had the highest sensitivity (S = 21.86) during 2000-2005. Based on the research results, we should focus on heavy precipitation events for flash flood prevention and forecasting in the short term; but human activities and ecosystem vulnerability should be controlled over the long term.

Substrates with nano/micro-scaled topographies that mimic the physiological niche are widely applied for tissue engineering applications. As the cartilage niche is composed of several stimulating factors, a multifunctional substrate providing topographical features while having the capability of electrical stimulation is presented. Herein, we demonstrate a biocompatible and conductive chondrocyte cell-imprinted substrate using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as conductive fillers. Unlike the conventional silicon wafers or structural photoresist masters used for molding, cell surface topographical replication is challenging as biological cells showed extremely sensitive to chemical solvent residues during molding. The composite showed no significant difference compared with PDMS with regard to cytotoxicity, whereas an enhanced cell adhesion was observed on the conductive composite's surface. Integration of nanomaterials into the cell seeding scaffolds can make tissue regeneration process more efficient.

Four mix designs were proposed. Three of them contained high, medium, and low grades of calcined clay, respectively, and one was the reference without calcined clay. In terms of extrudability, an extrusion test method based on the ram extruder was introduced to observe the quality of extruded material filaments, and to determine the extrusion pressure of tested materials at different ages. For evaluating the very early-age strength development, the penetration resistance test, the green strength test, and the ultrasonic pulse velocity test were applied. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the developed mix designs were determined by the compressive strength test at 1, 7 and 28 days. Finally, the main finding of this study was that increasing the metakaolin content in calcined clay could significantly increase the extrusion pressures and green strength, shorten the initial setting time and enhance the compressive strength at 1, 7, and 28 days.

One of the main concerns of using recycled glass in concrete is durability and particularly alkali-silica reaction (ASR). SEM-EDS analysis of the mortar with glass showed the formation of ASR gel with a higher silicon to calcium ratio around the glass particles which justified the large ASR expansion. On the other hand, microtomography analysis showed that the porous structure of concrete foam can accommodate the expansion of ASR gel inside the pores with considerably less expansion and no cracking. The majority of the pores filled with ASR gel are at the outer edge of the sample which was in contact with the alkaline solution. The smaller pores are more likely to be filled with ASR gel compared to the larger pores. Replacement of 10 wt% of Portland cement with milled glass resulted in higher strength compared to the other cementitious materials because of better compaction within the binder and pore strengthening effect due to rearrangement of pore sizes, as well as reduction of the unit weight. Recycled glass slightly decreased water absorption but substantially reduced the drying shrinkage of concrete foam.

J	Ma, WS; Yang, YQ; Yu, JJ				Ma, Wenshuo; Yang, Yiqing; Yu, Jingjun			General routine of suppressing single vibration mode by multi-DOF tuned mass damper: Application of three-DOF	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Tuned mass damper; Multiple; Multi-DOF; Vibration; Graphical approach	DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM; PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN; PARAMETERS; ABSORBER	The multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) tuned mass damper (TMD) has demonstrated a more effective performance than single-DOF and multiple SDOF TMDs. For a damping mass in the space, there are maximum six DOFs; however, only along the vibration direction of the main structure can the motion of the TMD be utilized to control the vibration mode. Therefore, the maximum available DOFs of a TMD for mitigating single translational mode are three (i.e. one translational DOF and two rotational DOFs). A general routine of suppressing single vibration mode by multi-DOF TMD is presented, especially, a three-DOF TMD is used for example. Based on the non-dimensional dynamic model, the design parameters of the TMD are optimized via the simulated annealing algorithm according to the Hoo criterion. The graphical approach is utilized to design the configuration of the TMD with prescribed DOFs. Stiffness and natural frequencies are formulated analytically by the compliance matrix method, based on which the dimensions of the TMD are determined. It is demonstrated that the SDOF and two-DOF TMDs are special cases of the three-DOF TMD from the point of mathematical modeling, numerical optimization and design methodology. Theoretical formulation is verified by conducting hammer tests on the TMD under various geometry configurations. After employing the three-DOF TMD, 86.5% reduction of the amplitude of the frequency response function (FRF) of an l-shaped part is achieved, which shows 29.5% improvement than previous two-DOF TMD.

Effect of Damping Modeling and Characteristics on Seismic Vulnerability Assessment of Multi-Frame Bridges	JOURNAL OF EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						Rayleigh damping; nonlinear time history analysis; fragility curves; bridges	FRAGILITY CURVES; METHODOLOGY	Rayleigh damping is a common method used to model energy dissipation in bridges, but improper damping modeling can develop spurious damping forces and lead to inaccurate results for dynamic analysis and seismic vulnerability assessment. The Rayleigh damping matrix contains mass-proportional and stiffness-proportional parts. To reduce or eliminate possible spurious forces, previous studies suggested using stiffness-proportional damping only and/or using the updated tangent stiffness matrix of the structure instead of the initial stiffness for the Rayleigh damping. The objective of this article is to study the effect of different damping modeling techniques and characteristics on the seismic response of multi-frame box-girder bridges and the resulting fragility curves for vulnerability assessment. Nonlinear time history analysis and incremental dynamic analysis are performed using 3D OpenSees bridge models to develop system and component fragility curves for different damping modeling scenarios. Different sources of uncertainties as related to earthquakes, structural geometries, and material properties are considered. The changes in fragility curves and median fragilities due to the different damping modeling scenarios are discussed. Confidence bounds for the developed fragility curves are presented as well to better understand the effect of damping on the developed fragility curves.

OPC is reportedly responsible for over 5% of the global CO2 emission. In addition, slag is an industrial by-product that must be land-filled if not re-used. Therefore, it has been studied by many investigators as environmentally friendly replacement of OPC. In addition to recycling, AAS offers favorable properties to concrete such as rapid development of compressive strength and high resistance to sulfate attack. Some of the potential shortcomings of AAS include high shrinkage, short setting time, and high rate of carbonation. Using ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) as an alternative to OPC requires its activation with high alkalinity compounds such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium sulfate (Na2SO3), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), or combination of these compounds such as NaOH and Na2SO3. The mechanism of alkali-activation is still not fully understood and further research is required. This paper overviews the properties, advantages, and potential shortcomings of AAS concrete.

The present study investigated compactability of aggregates and soils through the comparison of three laboratory compaction methods, the Superpave Gyratory Compactor, the Marshall impacting hammer, and a vibratory compacting machine. Accelerometers were attached to the Marshall impacting hammer and a laboratory scale vibratory compactor to capture the dynamic response of soils and aggregates during compaction. The results from this comparative experiment indicated that there was a consistent relationship between the stiffness of soils and aggregates and the dynamic responses from impaction and vibration, which can be used to better characterize the compactability of different paving materials through laboratory testing.

This paper examines the compressive strength development of low water-to-binder (w/b) ratio self-consolidating concrete (SCC) in which 90% of the cement is replaced with industrial by-products including ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), fly ash, and silica fume. The emphasis in this paper is on replacing a large volume of cement with GGBS, which represented 10% to 77.5% of the cement replaced. Fresh properties at w/b ratio of 0.27 were examined by estimating the visual stability index (VSI) and t50 time. The compressive strength was determined after 3, 7, 28, and 56 days of curing. The control mix made with 100% OPC developed compressive strength ranging from 55 MPa after three days of curing to 76.75 MPa after 56 days of curing. On average, sustainable SCC containing 10% OPC developed strength ranging from 31 MPa after three days of curing to 56.4 MPa after 56 days of curing. However, the relative percentages of fly ash, silica fume, and GGBS in the 90% binder affect the strength developed as well. In addition, this paper reports the effect of the curing method on the 28 day compressive strength of environmentally friendly SCC in which 90% of the cement is replaced by GGBS, silica fume, and fly ash. The highest compressive strength was achieved in samples that were cured for three days under water, then left to air-dry for 25 days, compared to samples cured using chemical compounds or samples continuously cured under water for 28 days. The study confirms that SCC with 10% OPC and 90% supplementary cementitious composites (GGBS, silica fume, fly ash) can achieve compressive strength sufficient for many practical applications by incorporating high amounts of GGBS. In addition, air-curing of samples in a relatively high temperature (after three days of water curing) produce a higher 28 day compressive strength compared to water curing for 28 days, or membrane curing.

While digital and robotics technologies have been well developed for construction 3D printing, the material aspect still faces critical issues to meet the evolving requirements for buildings. This research aims to develop performance indicators for 3D-printed materials used in construction regardless of the nature of the material. A general guideline is to be established as a result of this research. Thus, the literature review analyzes traditional durability approaches to construction materials and challenges are identified for potential applications in construction. The results suggest that performance indicators for 3D-printed materials should be checked as printable through an experimental case study. This research could be of interest to researchers, professionals, and start-ups in the construction and materials research fields.

Biofilm reactors (biofilters) create better conditions for nitrification and denitrification than suspended biomass reactors. The scope of the study included determination of the influence of the C/N ratio in the wastewater on nitrification, denitrification and organic compound removal in biofilm reactors depending on the temperature. The experiment was performed in 24 circular laboratory biofilters with LECA (Light Expanded Clay Aggregates) filling. The study was divided into three series differing in organic carbon loading. In each series, carried out at the same hydraulic retention time, biofilters were operated at 25, 8, 4 or 0 degrees C. The study showed the effective removal of nitrogen compounds across a very wide temperature range. The applied filling and properly selected operating parameters of the reactors resulted in effective simultaneous nitrification and denitrification. The highest efficiency of nitrogen removal at 0 degrees C (34.57 +/- 4.54%) was obtained at the C/N ratio of 0.5 gC/gN. The efficiency of denitrification (the lowest at the temperature of 0 degrees C) increased as the temperature and C/N ratio increased in the wastewater.

Geopolymers are an affordable class of materials that have promising applications in concrete structure coating, rehabilitation and sensing, due to their high chloride, sulphate, fire and freeze-thaw resistances and electrolytic conductivity. Work to date has, however, mainly focused on geopolymers that require curing at elevated temperatures, and this limits their ease of use in the field, particularly in cooler climates. Here, we outline a design process for fabricating ambient-cured fly ash geopolymer coatings for concrete substrates. Our technique is distinct from previous work as it requires no additional manufacturing steps or additives, both of which can bear significant costs. Our coatings were tested at varying humidities, and the impacts of mixing and application methods on coating integrity were compared using a combination of calorimetry, x-ray diffraction and image-processing techniques. This work could allow geopolymer coatings to become a more ubiquitous technique for updating ageing concrete infrastructure so that it can meet modern expectations of safety, and shifting requirements due to climate change.

However, the extended exposure of sealants to complex ambient conditions have negative impacts on sealant properties, causing gradual degradation of sealant performance and even more seriously, premature failure during their service. According to fracture modes of the failure interface, a weak boundary layer reportedly exists and results in adhesion failure of crack sealants. This work studied three environmental factors, namely, temperature, water, and impurities, to determine the effects of hostile ambient exposure on different crack sealants commonly used in hot and moderate climates. Tensile test was the main evaluation method, and the weak boundary layer (WBL) theory was introduced to illustrate the adhesion failure between sealant and crack wall. Analysis of experimental results showed that the lower temperature, the longer soaking time and the impurities would precipitate the eventual formation of a WBL. Sealants reached a glassy state and were likely to acquire brittle fracture at the interface at -30 degrees C. When soaked, sealants gradually hardened and water penetrated into the pores on the adhesive surface of the crack wall. Impurities at the interface hindered adhesion and reduced the contact area between sealant and crack wall. Consequently, the adhesion ability between interfaces dropped sharply and thus caused adhesion failure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kalhori, H; Bagherpour, R				Kalhori, Hamid; Bagherpour, Raheb			Prediction of shotcrete compressive strength using Intelligent Methods; Neural Network and Support Vector Regression	CEMENT WAPNO BETON			English	Article						Shotcrete; Compressive Strength; Micro-Silica; Neural Network; Support Vector Regression	CONCRETE; PARAMETERS; MODELS; SLUMP	Compressive strength is one of the most important mechanical properties of concrete. 28-day compressive strength test is the acceptance measure of concrete or shotcrete, which is highly affected by the mix design. Some parameters like water/cement ratio, amount of fine and coarse aggregates in mix, admixtures and so on affect shotcrete strength. Due to the large number of such parameters, it is very difficult to predict the shotcrete strength. Today, owing to intelligent methods, modeling has a particular role in engineering sciences and predicting material behavior. Therefore, this paper examines different mix designs of shotcrete containing microsilica and records their 28-day compressive strength. Regarding shotcrete mix design parameters as inputs, ANN and SVR models were used to predict compressive strength of shotcretes. The correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) statics are used for performance evaluation of proposed predictive models. All of the results showed that the accuracy of the proposed soft computing methods is quite satisfactory as compared to experimental results. The finding of this study indicated that the both ANN and SVM models are sufficient tools for estimating the compressive strength of shotcrete.

Response modification factor, fragility curves, ratio of different input energies to the structure affected by earthquake, maximum displacement and etcetera. are among these parameters, and most of these parameters are reviewed non-probabilistically. On one hand, since robustness index according to risk shapes probabilistically by reviewing uncertainty parameters of critical events and considering all existing parameters, it can be a beneficial index for reviewing the performance of improved structures. In this article, at first the robustness index is introduced according to risk analysis and one of its unique features is using percentage and amount of progressive collapse in it. After the considered robustness index, it has been used in reviewing the performance of a 4-story building of steel bending frame improved in two separate modes of concentrically brace frame and buckling restrained brace and a method has been suggested to obtain all effective parameters in intended robustness index. Ultimately, by reviewing this index for primary structure and improved structures, their behaviors have been compared and its results have been reported.

A time history of an actual earthquake in the literature with modification has been adopted in the numerical simulation and analysis of the tunnel responses. Meta-models have been constructed based on an experimental method with quadratic and interaction terms using matlab codes in order to predict the compressive damage, tensile damage, and the overall displacement of the tunnel. The results of the meta-models predicted a highly reasonable response of the tunnel with regard to the maximum principal stresses in the tunnel lining and predicted a remarkable response of the tunnel with respect to the overall displacement of the tunnel. Moreover, the peak ground acceleration was observed to exert the highest effect on the overall displacement of the tunnel, compared to the soil density and soil modulus of elasticity. Furthermore, the meta-models revealed the inverse relationship between the soil modulus of elasticity and the compressive and tensile damages of the tunnel lining. The meta-models exhibited high efficiency of representation of the behavior of the structural system during earthquakes. (C) 2018 Tongji University and Tongji University Press.

To this end, several self-consolidating concrete mixes were made using various mix proportions, and their rapid chloride penetrations (RCPT) were measured. The mix proportions and RCPT results were used as input and output variables, respectively, to train and test the proposed method. To verify accuracy of the FF-ABC model, its performance was compared to linear regression, genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) models. This comparison was conducted in three stages of training, validation, and testing. Results of this study indicate higher reliability of the FF-ABC model in comparison with the statistical, GA, and PSO models.

Piezoelectric energy harvesting in pavement aims to take advantage of the vehicle load on a road. Most of the existing theoretical and experimental research focused on the materials, structures, and shape of the energy harvesters to improve the efficiency of the output energy. However, few investigations have analyzed the compatibility of piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) and pavement. This study investigated the influence of PEHs on the structural response of asphalt pavement. Three-dimensional (3D) tire-pavement interaction finite-element models with and without a PEH were constructed according to a previous demonstration project. Several critical points within the pavement structures were selected and their mechanical responses induced by the passing tire were compared and discussed. A parametric study analyzed the pavement responses to different traffic speeds, tire loads, and bonding conditions between the PEHs and asphalt layers. Two potential optimization solutions for the PEH were explored. The results showed that the influence of the PEH on the asphalt pavement performance is significant in terms of the horizontal and vertical strains and von Mises stresses. A PEH causes potential permanent damage initiation in its adjacent area within the pavement structure. The maximum values of the horizontal tensile strains appeared at the bottom of the asphalt surface course in all pavement models with a PEH. These conclusions offer basic information for improving the practical design of PEHs in asphalt pavement.

The failure criterion is often built as the difference between a structural response and a threshold, which can be either deterministic or probabilistic. Within a probabilistic context, the structural response is a random variable and therefore, it will be subjected to a certain variability mostly depending on the structural typology and the assessment method. When engineers have to make a decision to choose the appropriate engineering demand parameter to consider, they need to know how much sensitive it will be. The study reported in this paper attempts to bring answers to this question. More precisely, the sensitivity of some engineering demand parameters is quantified and discussed as a function of the structural typology (beam-column or wall-based structures) and of the considered assessment method. The final output is a correlation matrix linking (i) the coefficient of variation of specific engineering demand parameters, (ii) the structural typology and (iii) the type of assessment method.

In the current study, an average true stress-true strain curve is proposed and used to model six large-scale WF brace members in combination with a refined fracture model. The effects of various material and geometric parameters are investigated. Increasing or reducing either or both the strength and the thickness of gusset plates by 10% or 20% has negligible effect on the hysteresis behaviour under reverse cyclic loading and the fracture of the large-scale WF brace members analysed.

To better control soil deformation, improve construction efficiency, and reduce pollution, this study proposed a prefabricated prestressed supporting structure. The structure consisted of prefabricated steel structure units and special prestressed components. The structure units were applied to retain the soil. The screws were used for prestressing. Field prototype tests were conducted to assess the support effects and analyze the stress and deformation behaviors of the shaft. The earth pressure, the stress in the structure unit, and the lateral displacement of the soil were monitored. The measured earth pressure varied between the earth pressure at rest and the passive earth pressure. The stress of the supporting structure was far less than the yield strength of steel. Changes in the earth pressure and structural stress can be divided into four stages: rapid attenuation, fluctuation, slow change, and stabilization. Both the earth pressure and the structure stress completed the major attenuation within three days of prestressing. The surrounding soil moved out from the shaft under prestress conditions and exhibited an obvious space-time effect. The study of stress and deformation provides guidance for the construction of newly prefabricated prestressed structures.

In this paper, previous works carried out on the effects of partial or full replacement of aggregate in concrete with waste rubber on some properties of concrete were investigated. A database containing 457 mixtures with partial or full replacement of natural aggregate with waste rubber in concrete provided by different researchers was formed. This database served as the basis for investigating the influence of partial or full replacement of natural aggregate with waste rubber in concrete on compressive strength. With the aid of the database, the possibility of achieving reliable prediction of the compressive strength of concrete with tire rubber is explored using neural network modelling.

Aerodynamic admittance is an essential parameter in analyzing buffeting performance. In this paper, aerodynamic admittance in different conditions were conducted in wind tunnel tests by section model. Three kinds of aerodynamic admittance functions were used to calculating buffeting performance respectively. It is found that the aerodynamic admittance of streamlined deck is closely related to wind attack angle, and has a small difference at different wind speeds. However, the influence of aerodynamic admittance on buffeting performance is affected by the wind speed significantly. Under given conditions, adopting the Sears function as the admittance function of a similar streamlined box girder is reasonable, while the buffeting performance result obtained by adopting an admittance function as 1.0 is very conservative.

However, little attention has been given to their impact on flow field and pressure distribution around a building, which is crucial for predicting convective heat transfer, pollutant dispersion, and indoor ventilation. Therefore, the present study combined a wind-tunnel experiment with computational fluid dynamics simulations to study a wind velocity profile, flow field patterns, and surface pressure around a cubic building with louver blinds. The louver blinds move windward flow separation in an upward direction and extend the recirculation region of a roof; moreover, some subvortices are generated between the two adjacent louver slats. Louver angle phi, installing distance W, and slat width B severely affect the generation of subvortices between slats and a conical vortex on the roof. Subsequently, blinds with different phi, W, and B exhibit different pressure distributions on the windward surface and top surface of a building.

Time-Dependent Seismic Fragilities of Older and Newly Designed Multi-Frame Reinforced Concrete Box-Girder Bridges in California	EARTHQUAKE SPECTRA			English	Article							PROBABILISTIC CAPACITY MODELS; CURVES; VULNERABILITY; METHODOLOGY; PERFORMANCE	Multi-frame box-girder reinforced concrete bridge is a common bridge class in California, characterized by the use of in-span hinges, which can have adverse effects, such as the pounding of adjacent frames and deck unseating during earthquakes. The goal of this study is to develop and compare a time-dependent overall system and individual components' fragility curves of older and newly designed multi-frame reinforced concrete bridges in California. These are designed based on the pre-1971 and post-1994 seismic design specifications, respectively. Confidence bounds were developed to investigate the variability in the developed fragility curves. The study shows that older bridges have higher fragilities than new bridges at the system level, and the overall bridge system fragilities are less affected by time-dependent corrosion compared to the column fragilities. Moreover, the developed fragilities were compared to what is available in HAZUS for a better assessment of the currently available tools for this bridge type.

Dynamic in-plane transversal normal stresses in the concrete face of CFRD	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						CFR dams; dynamic analysis; in-plane normal stresses; concrete face	STOCHASTIC PREDICTIONS; ROCKFILL MATERIALS; SEISMIC RESPONSE; FRAMEWORK; NANOCOMPOSITES; BEHAVIOR; DAMS	Severe earthquakes can induce damages to Concrete Face Rockfill Dams (CFRDs) such as concrete cracking and joint's water stops distressing where high in-plane transversal normal stresses develop. Although these damages rarely jeopardize the dam safety, they cause large water reservoir leakages that hinder the dam functioning. This issue can be addressed using well know numerical methods; however, given the wide range of parameters involved, it would seem appropriate to develop a simple yet reliable procedure to get a close understanding how their interaction affects the CFRD's overall behavior. Accordingly, once the physics of the problem is better understood one can proceed to perform a detailed design of the various components of the dam. To this end an easy-to-use procedure that accounts for the dam height effects, valley narrowness, valley slopes, width of concrete slabs and seismic excitation characteristics was developed. The procedure is the dynamic complement of a method recently developed to evaluate in-plane transversal normal stresses in the concrete face of CFRD's due to dam reservoir filling [1]. Using these two procedures in a sequential manner, it is possible to define the concrete slab in-plane normal stresses induced by the reservoir filling and the action of orthogonal horizontal seismic excitations acting at the same time upstream-downstream and cross river. Both procedures were developed from a data base generated using nonlinear static and dynamic three-dimensional numerical analyses on the same group of CFRD's. Then, the results were interpreted with the Buckingham Pi theorem and various relationships were developed. In the above reference, the method to evaluate the concrete face in-plane transversal normal stresses caused by the first reservoir filling was reported. In this paper, the seismic procedure is first developed and then through an example the whole method (dam construction, reservoir filling plus seismic loading) of analysis is assessed.

The firefly algorithm (FA) was used to optimize the weights in the ANN. For this purpose, the cement content, GGBFS content, water-to-binder ratio, fine aggregate content, coarse aggregate content, slump, the compaction factor of concrete and the age after loading were used as the input parameters, and in turn, the creep strain (epsilon(cr)) of the GGBFS concrete was considered as the output parameters. To evaluate the accuracy of the FA-ANN model, it was compared with the well-known genetic algorithm (GA), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Results indicated that the ANNs model, in which the weights were optimized by the FA, were more capable, flexible and precise than other optimization algorithms in predicting the epsilon(cr) of GGBFS concrete.

Method of forecasting the strength and thermal sensitive asphalt concrete	MAGAZINE OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						pavement; asphalt concret; bitumen; interphase layer; rheology; extensive and intensive factors; strength; thermal sensitive	RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; FILM THICKNESS; BITUMEN	A distinctive feature of composites is the manifestation of a synergistic effect due to the interaction of contacting substances at the interphase layer, and their intensity of interaction affects the volume properties of the composites. A study of the interphase layer of bitumen was carried out on the surface of the mineral powder. The proposed method according to the results of rheological tests allows calculating the thickness of the boundary layer in the binary system "asphalt - dispersed phase". The dependence of the road composite strength on the layer thickness of structured asphalt is established: the strength of the composite increases with increasing thickness of the bitumen layer. Method of assessing the impact on the structural-sensitive properties of the composite extensive factor m - indicator reflecting the influence of the interface area and intensive factor n - indicator reflecting the influence of physicochemical effects at the interface is proposed. The extensive factor has a greater effect on the properties of SMA-20 with a quartz filler m/n > 2. There is a higher rate of decrease in the intensity of physicochemical interactions at the interface of the "oil bitumen-silica filler" phase as compared with the extensive factor. The different nature of the effect of temperature on the extensive and intensive factors is observed for SMA-20 with diatomite: as temperature increases, the factor m increases, whereas the opposite effect is observed for factor n. It indicates a positive effect of the specific surface of diatomite on the temperature properties of asphalt concrete.	[Shekhovtsova, S.

Typically, fragility curves are constructed parametrically assuming a lognormal shape. In some cases, which cannot be identified a priori, differences may be observed between non-parametric fragility curves, evaluated empirically based on a large number of seismic response analyses, and their estimations via the lognormal assumption. Here, we present an optimized Monte Carlo procedure for derivation of non-parametric fragility curves. This procedure uses clustering of the intensity measure data to construct the non-parametric curve and parametric models averaging for optimized assessment. In simplified case studies presented here as illustrative applications, the developed procedure leads to a fragility curve with reduced bias compared to the lognormal curve and to reduced confidence intervals compared to an un-optimized Monte Carlo-based approach. In the studied cases, this procedure proved to be efficient providing reasonable estimations even with as few as 100 seismic response analyses.

The vulnerability associated with this city has increased due to haphazard development, owing to rapid urbanization and industrial development. This article focuses on evaluating the performance of an existing mid-rise RC frame building in a densely populated area of the city. The selected stock building is precisely modeled in SAP2000 for carrying out its pushover analysis from which the capacity spectrum is obtained as per the recommendations of ATC-40. Finally, the Fragility curve is produced as per the guidelines of HAZUS and the damageability function of the building is calculated. From the results of fragility curve and damage probability function, it is deduced that the building will suffer extensive damage during a seismic event.

Impact of unstructured factors on concrete through fuzzy models	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Construction site factors; concrete strength	COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; LOGIC; SYSTEMS; ANFIS	Concrete is influenced by affecting conditions during its production and construction processes. The literature reveals that there is limited understanding about the effect of unstructured factors (i.e., construction site factors) on concrete product. Crew experience, compaction method, mixing time, curing humidity, and curing temperature were selected to quantify their impact on concrete compressive strength, fabrication cost, and production rates. Each response was measured and utilized for fuzzy modeling. A Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system (FIS) was obtained for quantifying each response. Model validation was accomplished by plotting predicted versus experimental data while sensitivity analysis used Monte Carlo simulation and Spearman's correlation coefficients. Curing temperature was identified as the most influential factor for concrete compressive strength while mixing time was identified to have the largest impact on concrete cost and production rates. All FISs can be used as supporting tools to discern desired concrete operating conditions.

J	Tang, LM; Xiao, DY				Tang, Limin; Xiao, Duyang			Monthly Attenuation Prediction for Asphalt Pavement Performance by Using GM (1,1) Model	ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								Due to the uncertainty and variability of various factors affecting the pavement performance, the change in pavement performance cannot be completely determined. In addition, this uncertainty is not accurately reflected by the pavement performance prediction model. In particular, the gray GM (1, 1) model is very suitable due to it is ability to better predict the existing situation of a domestic asphalt pavement along with the actual performance of a road surface of the small sample, poor information gray system. In this regard, the gray GM (1, 1) model is being increasingly used to forecast the performance of an asphalt pavement. When a gray GM (1, 1) model is used to predict the performance of an asphalt pavement, the condition number of the GM (1, 1) model matrix is too large, which, in turn, leads to the deviation of calculation and even wrong results in some cases. This study analyzed the reason for a large condition number of the GM (1, 1) model matrix. Combined with the numerical characteristics of the pavement condition index (PCI) and pavement quality index (PQI), this study focused on the annual, monthly, and daily attenuations of PCI and PQI to the condition number of the GM (1, 1) model matrix. Accordingly, we propose a method to forecast the performance of an asphalt pavement using the monthly attenuation of PCI and PQI. The PCI and PQI in Hunan Province in recent years have been predicted, and the findings reveal that the prediction GM (1, 1) model for the monthly attenuation of PCI and PQI not only effectively lowered the condition number of the matrix but also ensured that the relative error was small.

Performances of these soft computing techniques were compared with previous studies of cumulative infiltration of soil. Laboratory experiments were carried out on soil samples with predetermined moisture contents and different compositions of rice husk ash and fly ash and accordingly, 413 observations were obtained. The evaluation of results suggests that the RF model performs better than other considered models and it could effectively be used in the modeling of the cumulative infiltration. The bagged approach was found to perform well with the M5P tree model than the RF model. Sensitivity analysis concludes that cumulative time, suction head and moisture content were the most important parameters. In addition, parametric studies were also carried out.

For most building codes, concrete structural components and systems are designed for the 28-day compressive strength. Nonetheless, concrete structures are cured typically for only 3 to 7 days. There is an increasing use of curing techniques that involve chemical compounds such as acrylic-based compounds. The emergence of such techniques requires investigation of their effectiveness, compared to traditional curing methods. This article presents the findings of a study to compare the compressive strength of concrete cured using three methods, namely submersion in water, air curing under elevated temperature, and curing with a chemical compound. Compressive strength was determined on standard 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm cubes made of sustainable self-consolidated concrete (SCC) in which 90% of ordinary Portland cement content was replaced with combinations of high volume ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), silica fume, and fly ash. A total of 20 mixes were tested, the first set of 10 mixes prepared with water to be binder (w/b) ratio of 0.33 and the second set of 10 mixes prepared with w/b of 0.36. For all mixes, samples cured under air with 45 degrees C temperature produced the highest 28-day compressive strength compared to other curing methods. Similarly, concrete samples cured using the chemical compound produced higher compressive strength compared to the traditional curing method. The sustainable SCC mix producing the highest compressive strength of 76.22 MPa under air curing was prepared with w/b of 0.33, 72.5% slag replacement ratio, 12.5% silica fume replacement ratio, 10% fly ash while Portland cement represented only 10% of the total binder content.

Such data can influence the early-age hydration of CAC. Better understanding of the data is applied to predict and manipulate its early-age hydration. It is well-understood that at 20 degrees C the CAC compositions of CaAl2O4 center dot 10H(2)O (CAH(10)) and Ca2Al2O5 center dot 8H(2)O (C(2)AH(8)) were the main hydrated products. Results in the study indicated that the nucleation of calcium phase was the controlling nucleation mechanism, not the aluminate. The calculated gamma-value of CAH(10) was lower than the C(2)AH(8); meaningly, CAH(10) was more stable than C(2)AH(8). SEM images also revealed two-dimensional (2D) mediated growth of CAH(10). Based on the theoretical predictions and SEM study, the crystal growth mechanism for CAC system at 20 degrees C was the 2D-mediated growth mechanism.

Strain-Hardening Cementitious Composite (SHCC) is a kind of short random fibre reinforced cementitious composites exhibiting robust tensile strain-hardening and multiple cracking, which has potentials to reduce or even eliminate the need for steel reinforcements in printed concrete structures. Since one of the main disadvantages of 3D-printed structures is the anisotropy, this study aims to evaluate the impact of 3D printing directions on the tensile and compressive performance of self-reinforced SHCC materials. Four series of SHCC specimens with the same mix proportion but different printing patterns (including Parallel, Perpendicular, Cross and Normal Casting) were prepared and tested under uniaxial tension and compression, and the single-crack fibre-bridging constitutive relations were micromechanically modelled to physically support the experimental results. The findings of this study can support the future design and manufacturing of 3D-printed concrete structures using fibre-reinforced materials.	[Yu, Jing; Leung, Christopher K.

The pipeline outputs a freeform 3D landscape with plant seeds attached onto its surface; by providing this printed foundation with adequate water and light (and later nutrient solutions), eventually the plants will grow, with the foundation effectively serving as a growth medium through which roots can permeate. The pipeline is flexible, and can be customized to suit different scales and applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline through quantitative evaluations, and also provide a list of plants that have been successfully cultivated using our technique. The paper will conclude with a discussion on how the pipeline may be further extended to realize fabrication of more complex ecological systems.

There are two wedge-shaped sliding surfaces and an integrated equal-strength beam structure, which make the sensor have the advantages of anti-sliding interference and high sensitivity of beam deflection displacement measurement. The sensor prototype is manufactured and the related performance tests show that the sensitivity of the sensor is 11.921731 pm/mm in the range of 100 mm to 100 mm, and the correlation coefficient of the fitting curve has reached 0.9996. Compared with the theoretical calculation value, the measured wavelength drift of the full scale deviates by about 0.92% and 0.42%, which can meet the accuracy requirements of structural health monitoring of major facilities such as civil engineering for displacement and deformation measurement. Four calibrated displacement sensors are installed on the top beam of the foundation pit of Beijing Dazing International Airport, the world's largest aviation hub, to monitor the deformation of foundation pit in real time. The reason of the displacement change of each monitoring section is analysed and the actual working condition on the site is checked. The effectiveness of the FBG bidirectional displacement sensing in the displacement monitoring of foundation pit engineering is verified.

J	Wang, H; Wang, ZL				Wang, Hao; Wang, Zilong			Deterministic and probabilistic life-cycle cost analysis of pavement overlays with different pre-overlay conditions	ROAD MATERIALS AND PAVEMENT DESIGN			English	Article						pavement overlay; pre-overlay condition; life-cycle cost analysis; surface distress index; deterministic and probabilistic approaches	REFLECTIVE CRACKING; ASPHALT PAVEMENT; PERFORMANCE; METHODOLOGY	This study aims to evaluate the effect of pre-overlay condition on pavement performance and develop deterministic and probabilistic approaches to analyse the cost-effectiveness of pavement overlay alternatives. Pavement-condition data collected from Pavement Management System were used to analyse the service life of pavement overlay with different pre-overlay conditions and overlay thicknesses. Deterministic and probabilistic life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) was first conducted to compare life-cycle cost (LCC) of different overlay treatments. Statistical test proves that the estimated overlay life for major rehabilitation is significantly higher than the overlay life for minor rehabilitation. Deterministic LCCA results show that there is a threshold of pre-overlay surface distress index (SDI) where the LCC is equal between major and minor rehabilitation treatments. Sensitivity analyses show that the cost ratio between major and minor rehabilitation treatments has significant influence on the threshold of SDI. Probabilistic LCCA results demonstrate the possible variations of LCC for different rehabilitation treatments. A probability index is proposed to quantify the probability that the LCC of minor rehabilitation is greater than the LCC of major rehabilitation. The analysis results show that probability index decreases as the pre-overlay SDI value increases or the cost ratio between major and minor rehabilitation treatments increases. The cost-effectiveness of rehabilitation treatments can be analysed using the LCCA approach developed in this study considering different pavement performance indicators and analysis parameters.

Blast and impact loading effects on glass and steel elements and materials	THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES			English	Review						Blast experimentation; Impact testing; Numerical analysis; Glass laminated window; Steel hollow section; Energy-dissipating connector	HOLLOW SECTIONS; STRAIN-RATE; BEHAVIOR	A review of recent research performed by the University of Toronto on blast and impact loading of structures in the last few years is presented. The structural elements and materials considered are: cold-formed square hollow structural sections (HSS), composite concrete-filled HSS, composite double-skin HSS, architectural glazing (annealed soda lime glass) and multi-layered laminated glazing panels, as well as energy-dissipating steel connectors. The research methodologies employed are: very large-scale arena testing by far-field air blasts, full-scale laboratory testing (including the use of a servo-hydraulic 'blast generator'), small-scale material dynamic testing (including the use of Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar apparatus), analysis using single degree of freedom (SDOF) models, and analysis using explicit (dynamic) finite element programs (including both in-house, purpose-written software and commercial programs such as LS-DYNA). Insights into high-strain-rate material behaviour and its modelling have been gained and used in comparing numerical models against test results.
