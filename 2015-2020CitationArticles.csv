The shells are constructed with hydrophilic segments of poly(acrylic acid)-co-poly(isobutenyl polyethenoxy ether) (PAA-co-PHPEG), offering the water-reducing performance and stability for nano-PCEs. The cores are self-assembled with hydrophobic segments of polystyrene-co-poly(hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PS-co-PHEA), endowing nano-PCEs with good loss resistant of fluidity for cement pastes. The chemical structure of nano-PCEs was verified by the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum (H-1 NMR) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and the 16 - 48 nm diameter of nano-PCE nanomicelles was determined by dynamic laser scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Compared with comb PCEs, the cement paste containing nano-PCEs exhibited better fluidity retention of three hours by minislump measurements, lower hydration heat and more delayed hydration heat evolution by isothermal calorimetry tests. Furthermore, the hydrolysis and adsorption behavior of nano-PCEs in alkaline cement pastes were deduced, and a working mechanism of nano-PCEs was theoretically explained. This new type of superplasticizer nanomicelles can be used as a long time rheology modifying agent in fresh cementitious systems.

J	Hu, XF; Ding, X; Zhao, YG; Yao, WA				Hu, Xiaofei; Ding, Xing; Zhao, Yanguang; Yao, Weian			On a symplectic analytical singular element for cracks under thermal shock considering heat flux singularity	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Symplectic approach; Thermal shock; Stress intensity factor; Heat flux intensity factor	STRESS INTENSITY FACTORS; FINITE-ELEMENT; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; HAMILTONIAN APPROACH; GROWTH SIMULATIONS; BARRIER COATINGS; CONDUCTION; XFEM; DELAMINATION; PROPAGATION	In a precise numerical modelling of cracks under thermal shock, the singularity issue resulted from heat flux should also be considered in addition to the one resulted from stress. The assumptions of constant temperature distribution usually adopted in the existing studies may lead to significant error. The concerned problem involves the discretization in both space and time domains. Numerical error resulted from the singularity issues in the space domain may be accumulated in the time domain. Hence, a unified framework which integrates reliable methods for both space and time domains are desired. In the present contribution, the classic thermal stress problem is restudied under the Hamiltonian system and the eigen functions are obtained analytically. A symplectic analytical singular element (SASE) for thermal stress analysis is reformulated based on the existing ones for thermal conduction and stress analyses. The singularity issues of both stress and heat flux are considered. A unified framework is formed with the precise time domain expanding algorithm (PTDEA) for the time domain and the formulated SASE for the space domain. A self-adaptive technique is used for the PTDEA to improve the numerical efficiency. The time dependent fracture parameters i.e., heat flux intensity factors (HFITs) and the mixed mode thermal stress intensity factors (TSIFs) can be solved accurately without any post-processing. Numerical examples are given for verification and validation of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	You, LY; Yan, KZ; Yue, YF; Yu, T				You, Lingyun; Yan, Kezhen; Yue, Yufei; Yu, Tao			Comparisons of Natural and Enhanced Asphalt Mixtures Containing Recycled Cement-Stabilized Macadam as Aggregates	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Hot-mix asphalt (HMA); Recycled aggregates; Cement-stabilized macadam (CSM); Surface treatments; Methanesiliconic acid sodium salt solution (MASS); Moisture resistance	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; HYDRATED LIME; MIX DESIGN; PERFORMANCE; CONCRETE; FILLER; IMPACT; SURFACTANT; ADDITIVES; STRENGTH	The recycling of cement-stabilized macadam (CSM) is beneficial from the effective utilization of resources and the viewpoint of environmental preservation. For the effective utilization of CSM, it is useful to use CSM as recycled aggregates for hot-mix asphalt (HMA) productions as aggregates. In order to make this technology feasible, mixture design, chemical and physical properties, and durability of recycled aggregate hot-mix asphalt (RAHMA) should be engaged in the processing of demolished CSM. The objective of this study is to develop one RAHMA by recycling the base layer of semirigid pavements, and to assess the performance of natural and methanesiliconic acid sodium salt solution (MASS) enhanced RAHMA. Initial laboratory results find that the MASS treatments were beneficial to the performance of RAHMA; however, moisture resistance was found to be unsatisfactory. To improve moisture resistance, cement and hydrated lime fillers were applied in this study. The combined 1.75% by weight cement/ hydrated lime (1:1) was found to perform the best of the cases utilizing improved moisture resistance of RAHMA. Also, all of the residue Marshall stability ratio (MS0) and the splitting tensile strength ratio (TSR) were found to meet specifications. However, although the unaging and short-term aging performance of RAHMA were successful, all of the moisture resistance indicators of long-term aged RAHMA fell below standard rirements. Therefore, the long-term performance of the proposed RAHMA rires further improvement and study. While the particular use for RAHMA needs improvement concerning moisture durability, the enhancement methods mentioned in this study should be considered in the application of recycling CSM in hot-mix asphalt productions.

We start from formulating the problem with the principle of minimum potential energy in a 3D solid, with the displacement field and the phase field as primary arguments. We then select, for each cross section, representative fields that characterize the said cross section, including the beam deflection and rotation, and two independent ansatz variables within the cross section to represent the phase field. The problem then reduces to a minimization with only one-dimensional field variables. A feature of the proposed method is, without discretizing the phase field within the cross section, it can represent its variation within the cross section, allowing to simulate cracks partially going through the thickness due to bending as well as axial loads.

The adaptive refinement is driven by a recovery-based error estimator. The formulation is employed for bending and vibration analysis. We compare different strategies for refinement, enrichment and evaluation of fracture parameters. The obtained results are shown to be in a good agreement with the reference solutions.

Static and Free Vibration Analyses of Functionally Graded Carbon Nanotube Reinforced Composite Plates using CS-DSG3	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS			English	Article						Smoothed finite element methods; cell-based smoothed discrete shear gap method (CS-DSG3); carbon nanotube reinforced composite (CNTRC) plates; uniformly distributed carbon nanotube reinforced composite (UD-CNTRC) plates; functionally graded carbon nanotube reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC) plates	SHEAR DEFORMATION-THEORY; DYNAMIC-ANALYSIS; TRIANGULAR ELEMENTS; ELASTIC PROPERTIES; MINDLIN PLATES; BEAMS; NANOCOMPOSITES	This study presents an extension of the cell-based smoothed discrete shear gap method (CS-DSG3) using three-node triangular elements for the static and free vibration analyses of carbon nanotube reinforced composite (CNTRC) plates. The single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are assumed to be uniformly distributed (UD) and functionally graded (FG) distributed along the thickness direction. The material properties of carbon nanotube-reinforced composite plates are estimated according to the rule of mixture. The governing equations are developed based on the first-order shear deformation plate theory (FSDT). In the CS-DSG3, each triangular element will be divided into three sub-triangles, and in each sub-triangle, the stabilized discrete shear gap method is used to compute the strains and to avoid the transverse shear locking. Then the strain smoothing technique on the whole triangular element is used to smooth the strains on these three sub-triangles. Effects of several parameters, such as the different distribution of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), nanotube volume fraction, boundary condition and width-to-thickness ratio of plates are investigated. In addition, the effect of various orientation angles of CNTs is also examined in detail. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed method are verified by comparing its numerical solutions with those of other available results in the literature.

Stabilization and solidification of arsenic and iron contaminated canola meal biochar using chemically modified phosphate binders	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS			English	Article						Adsorption; Stabilization; Arsenic; Heavy metals; Leaching; Risk assessment	MSWI FLY-ASH; HEAVY-METALS; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; SPENT ADSORBENT; FURNACE SLAG; STABILIZATION/SOLIDIFICATION; CEMENT; LIME; IMMOBILIZATION; HYDROCARBONS	Adsorption is a widely used process for removal of heavy metals, but the management of spent adsorbent containing concentrated amounts of heavy metals is a problem due to potential risk of groundwater contamination from leaching of heavy metals. Generally, cementitious binder and additives are used for stabilization and solidification treatment, however heavy metals tend to leach from such matrices. Therefore, this research investigated the effectiveness of chemically modified phosphate biochar (CMPB) composite for the simultaneous solidification and stabilization of arsenic (As) and iron (Fe) contaminated canola meal biochar. Results showed that the performance of spent biochar added CMPB composites was significantly better than the pure composites (without biochar) due to filling of inter-aggregate pores using biochar and availability of sufficient amount of MgKPO4 for binding of biochar particles. Moreover, leaching test and risk assessment studies indicated that there is no potential adverse effect as the concentrations of As and Fe in TCLP leachate were well below the Universal Treatment Standard (UTS) in optimized CMPB composites. In conclusion, chemically modified phosphate binders were found effective in stabilization and solidification of As and Fe contaminated biochar into thermodynamically stable material with high immobilization capacity and low leachability.

To describe the poromechanics of saturated materials, Biot theory is incorporated into the semi-Lagrangian formulation and a damage model is embedded into Drucker-Prager constitutive model to simulate the soil behavior and separation during the impact and penetration process. The stabilized nodal domain integration is developed in the two-field semi-Lagrangian RK formulation to ensure numerical stability, and the kernel contact algorithm is implemented to model the interaction between soil and projectile bodies. Several examples are studied to validate and assess the proposed method's performance in predicting the final penetration depth, and the results are compared to those reported in the literature.

In this study, it was attempted to optimize an oscillating water column (OWC) wave energy converter, which is constructed on a shoreline. This study proposed numerical and physical models for the optimization of the OWC-type wave energy converters. Sixty-four experimental sets were carried out by a piston-type wave maker in order to investigate the influence of wave parameters, water depth and geometry of coastal structures on the efficiency of the system. A numerical model of the experimental model sets of the OWC system was performed by a software called Flow 3D. Intersection with a water-air in the software for the determination of the free surface of a volume of fluid method is used. K-epsilon turbulence model was used for turbulent model. The drag coefficient, surface roughness, pipe roughness and surface tension were used for calibration. It is observed that the numerical model results follow the experimental model results. The numerical and the experimental model results were compared with each other by taking into consideration the mean squared error, coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) as performance evaluation criteria. According to the test results, the NSE value was obtained to be 0.97 and this value also shows very good agreement between numerical results and experimental results. The experimental results showed that wave parameters are strongly related to the outflow of air from the chamber, whereas the slope angle of the chamber is inversely related. Considering different water depths, the various wave series and angle of the chamber, maximum efficiency of OWC was obtained at 50 cm, wave series No. 1 and an angle of 40 degrees, respectively.

J	Zheng, ZJ; Yu, J; Wei, FF; Wu, J				Zheng, Zejun; Yu, Jun; Wei, Fangfang; Wu, Jun			Numerical study of blast performance of concrete filled double-steel-plate composite walls	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROTECTIVE STRUCTURES			English	Article						Composite structure; concrete filled double-steel-plate composite wall; blast response; axial compression; numerical study	STRENGTH	Currently, terrorism attack is one of the main concerns in public safety, although the probability of such attack is fairly low. From the perspective of multi-hazard mitigation, it is expected that the structural members that are used to resist earthquakes or winds in buildings should also reduce the vulnerability to blast. Concrete filled double-steel-plate composite walls are one of the novel structural members which are used as shear walls, in which concrete is filled between two steel plates and connected to them through shear studs. In this article, finite-element-based analyses were carried out to investigate the dynamic behaviour of concrete filled double-steel-plate composite walls subjected to blast loading. A three-dimensional numerical model was developed and validated based on previously published experimental results. Then, the numerical models were employed to investigate the effects of axial compression ratio, concrete strength, wall thickness and shear connector spacing on the blast performance of concrete filled double-steel-plate composite walls under different blast intensities. The results show that axial compression has both positive and negative effects on the blast performance of concrete filled double-steel-plate composite walls. The positive effect prevails due to increased effective flexural stiffness when plastic deformation under zero axial compression and the same blast load is marginal, whereas the negative effect is more dominant due to P-delta effect when evident plastic deformation occurs under zero axial compression and the same blast load.

Such types of failure start with a local damage which extension increases, up to the whole structure. First, emphasis is placed on the current techniques to study collapse propagation, i.e., numerical, experimental and analytical. In particular, the various numerical methods found in the literature are reported and discussed and the experimental studies and technologies involved in the laboratory tests are listed and compared. As reviewed, the method of analysis depends on the collapse mechanism and the triggering event. Thus, an in-depth review of the collapse typologies is proposed. Pure and mixed progressive collapse mechanisms are discussed and debated. The various triggering events, their modeling and their effects on the framed structures are examined. Details on the available literature on multi-hazard scenarios are provided. Finally, robustness techniques against progressive collapse are summarized, compared and contrasted. The paper concludes with an ambitious comprehensive list of open questions and issues covering different aspects of future needs.

In this study, 10 population-based metaheuristic techniques are applied to identify the location and severity of damage in large-scale spatial truss structures. Two examples from the relevant literature are considered under various damage settings to compare the efficacy of the recent swarm intelligence-based optimization methods. A combined natural frequencies and mode shapes-based objective function has been used in the present study for the damage detection purpose. The effect of noise is incorporated in the dynamic responses to study the efficiency of the best algorithm out of 10 possibilities in identifying damages in noisy environments. The results indicate the superiority of teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) technique over other optimization techniques in identifying damages with effective precision. Furthermore, with TLBO the number of function evaluations and computation time required in the optimization process is substantially reduced.

These expenses are traditionally associated with the extra large tangent stiffness matrix and a huge number of elements which need to be re-integrated in every iteration. In this work we incorporate the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) into the SL-FEM, thus performing a drastic reduction of the stiffness matrix. In order to reduce the integration costs by hyperreduction, a novel element-based modification of the discrete empirical interpolation, the so-called element-based empirical approximation method (EDEAM), is developed and combined with the POD. Particular advantages of the SL-FEM for order reduction and hyperreduction compared to other stochastic techniques are discussed. The new reduced-order SL-FEM is applied to the computational homogenization of materials with random geometry of the microstructure, i.e. to a general class of problems exhibiting strongly nonlinear, non-smooth and sometimes discontinuous dependency of the solution on some random parameters. The reduced-order SL-FEM demonstrates a high accuracy and a high solution speed, whereby the solution time for the reduced-order SL-FEM is comparable to the solution time of only one single Monte-Carlo sample.

These traditional drainage systems cannot consider important utilisation of storm water. Therefore, a decentralised storm water management option, known as, Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) technologies, can be implemented in the urban catchments to minimise the negative hydrological impacts due to urbanisation. Hydraulic designs of three different types of infiltration-based WSUD technologies (leaky wells, soakaways and infiltration trenches) were designed for South Australian contexts. Modelling equations to estimate optimum numbering of infiltration systems were developed using SPSS and six different independent variables, such as soil hydraulic conductivity, size of the device, average recurrence interval of rainfall events, critical storm duration, rainfall intensity and roof size, were considered. The developed modelling equations were statistically significant and were applied in the real-case scenarios of South Australian catchments.

The resulting rotation will further aggravate the damage of the structure. A mathematical model is developed to study the translation and rotation response of the structure during seismic excitation. The motion equations of the structures which cover the translation and rotation are obtained by the theoretical derivations and calculations. Through the simulated computation, the translation and rotation response of the structure with the uncontrolled system, the tuned mass damper control system, and active tuned mass damper control system using linear quadratic regulator algorithm are compared to verify the effectiveness of the proposed active control system. In addition, the linear quadratic regulator and fuzzy neural network algorithm are used to the active tuned mass damper control system as a contrast group to study the response of the structure with different active control method. It can be concluded that the structure response has a significant reduction by using active tuned mass damper control system. Furthermore, it can be also found that fuzzy neural network algorithm can replace the linear quadratic regulator algorithm in an active control system. Because fuzzy neural network algorithm can control the process on an uncertain mathematical model, it has more potential in practical applications than the linear quadratic regulator control method.

This paper presents a finite element model updating (FEMU) algorithm based on crows search algorithm incorporated with Levy flight (LFCSA). The proposed algorithm is tested on the updating of two different cases: a simple structure (beam) and a complex structure (gearbox housing). To verify the performance of LFCSA, two optimization algorithm, which is the standard CSA and the particle swarm optimization algorithm with Levy flight (LFPSO), are applied to FEMU of the simple beam. The result of the comparison shows that the LFCSA has sufficient convergence speed and global search ability in the implementation of FEMU. In the case of gearbox housing, the error of frequencies and mode shapes are analyzed to indicate that the LFCSA gives a satisfactory result in a complex structure.

The difficulty to be overcome in this experimental campaign was to investigate the limited soil size considered for this complex geodynamic problem due to the small capacity of the shaking table having payload of 2.5 kN and the geometry of testing platform of 1 m x 1 m, respectively. The superstructure used in the analysis of the soil-structure interaction is specified as six story building structure with height of 30 m resting on a silty sand soil with a shear wave velocity of 536 m/s. Within the frame of this work, the underlying soil is handled as a homogeneous single layer on the top of rigid bedrock. The diameter of the ground specimen and the bedrock depth were considered to be 26.23 m and 10 m, respectively. Special cylindrical flexible testing equipment was designed to hold the excavated soil volume in the container without deforming the experimental setup. In order to examine the seismic responses at the control points of the scaled test models under the nonlinear supporting effects, 2-D finite element analyses of the soil-structure system have been executed by using the PLAXIS simulation program. It is obviously seen that the soil layer parameters have significantly increased the free-field site response compared with the bedrock response under different seismic excitations. Based on the comparison of calculated results with experimental recordings, it is suitable to mention that small capacity shaking table experiments with appropriate scaled test models provides an alternative means of laboratory investigations even for such complex soil-structure coupling problems.

In this research, we develop streamflow forecasts for Lake Urmia basin, Iran, specifically for inflow into the Boukan and Mahabad reservoirs. In doing so, two types of inflow forecast models are considered: a single site univariate model ignoring the cross correlation between streamflow at different stations, and a multi-site multivariate forecast model which takes into consideration the cross correlations among stations. Predictor selection is performed through a principal component analysis and an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system is used to forecast streamflow. Forecast performance is investigated by employing different combinations of large-scale climatic information and hydrologic data. We found that gridded ocean-atmospheric circulation variables, including surface precipitation rate and omega (pressure vertical velocity), have the highest correlations (about 0.7) with annual streamflow. In general, multivariate models are able to better preserve the annual cross-correlations between streamflow at different stations, as expected, without sacrificing forecast skill as compared to the univariate forecast model approach. Additionally, as compared with the baseline feed-forward artificial neural network- and traditional multiple linear regression-forecast models, the results were approximately the same. This similarity in the forecast performance between the linear and nonlinear models is likely due to the short of data (44-sample record).

Asphalt mixture is actually a multi-phase heterogeneous material that is composed of air voids, aggregate and asphalt binder. In this study, asphalt specimens were drilled from a test track and the indirect tensile fatigue test was conducted to study the fatigue properties. Digital Image Processing (DIP) was used to investigate the microstructural changes of the asphalt specimens based on X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) images. The aggregate orientation and number of aggregate contact points were determined. The distribution of the air-voids content and shape index of air voids before and after the fatigue tests were comprehensively discussed. According to the results, the microscopic analysis can effectively predict the evolutions of the internal structures of asphalt mixtures during fatigue damage. The heterogeneity due to different degrees of compaction significantly affects the fatigue properties of the asphalt mixtures. This study not only provides support for the further research on the relationship between the microstructural characteristics and mechanical damages of asphalt mixture but also provides implications for conducting the structural mechanical analysis of asphalt pavement.

J	Gupta, S; Wei, KH; Dai, PS				Gupta, Souradeep; Wei, Kua Ham; Dai, Pang Sze			Effect of biochar on mechanical and permeability properties of concrete exposed to elevated temperature	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Article						Biochar; Concrete; Permeability; Strength; Silica fume	HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONCRETE; RUBBER-WOOD-SAWDUST; SILICA FUME; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; PORE PRESSURE; CEMENT PASTE; FLY-ASH; MORTAR; WASTE	Although many inorganic fillers have been explored as supplementary cementitious admixtures, there is limited exploration into role of porous biochar, prepared from lignocellulosic biomass, in modifying mechanical and durability performance of structural grade concrete exposed to elevated temperature. This study investigates the effect of biochar particles, prepared by pyrolysis of woody biomass at 500 degrees C (BC 500), on mechanical strength (compressive, flexural and split-tensile strength) and permeability properties of concrete under normal condition (only wet-curing) and after exposure to high temperature (300 degrees C and 550 degrees C in this study) at 28-day age. Biochar was added at 0.50%, 1% and 2% by weight of cement in concrete. Thermal damage was inflicted to 28-day wet-cured concrete samples by placing in an electric kiln with residence time of 1 h (at steady state) and ramp rate of 5 degrees C/min. The strength and permeability performance of biochar-concrete composite were compared with plain concrete and concrete with 10 wt% silica fume (SF 10%) exposed to similar conditions. The findings show that addition of 0.50 wt% and 2 wt% of BC 500 increase 28-day compressive strength of concrete by 16% and 9% respectively compared to control mix, while 2 wt% addition led to reduction in permeability by 40%, measured by water sorptivity and water penetration test. After exposure to elevated temperature, addition of 1-2 wt% BC 500 to concrete is found to minimize thermal damage and retain 20% and 11% higher strength compared to control and concrete with silica fume respectively. Investigations show that biochar addition leads to lower damage to microstructure of concrete during thermal treatment, leading to 22-25% higher water tightness compared to control mix. The findings suggest that biochar from wood waste can be applied as a sustainable admixture and alternative to silica fume in order to improve compressive strength and durability of structure exposed to high temperature. Nevertheless, this can be also be an effective means to valorize lignocellulosic waste for high value construction applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A base asphalt binder with penetration grade 60/70 was utilised in this study. The crumb rubber and natural rubber latex were added at different percentages for the modified bitumen production, and computed based on the mass of bitumen. Silane additives at the rate of 0.1% by mass of asphalt binder were used as a surfactant. A series of rheological properties and recovery test were conducted on all binders. While bond test and Layer-Parallel Direct Shear (LPDS) test were carried out in order to simulate the crack movement of pavement. The results show that the addition of crumb rubber and latex positively impacts the performance of the asphalt binder. The crumb rubber and natural rubber latex modified asphalt binder has comparatively identical elastic recovery outcomes, while it also helps in enhancing the stiffness in terms of softening and penetration value. However, natural rubber latex modified asphalt binder performed much better than crumb rubber modified asphalt binder in terms of torsional recovery. Whereas, rotational viscosity test has been useful in adopting the suitable temperature which is 160 degrees C in order to satisfy the needs of better workability and to ensure it is pumpable. Storage stability test proved that the modified asphalt binders are homogenous since the temperature differences are less than 5 degrees C. The dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) test proved that the modified asphalt binder has better resistance to rutting. Through DSR findings and activation energy, the modified asphalt binder were catogorize as less susceptible to temperature changes. Finally, the crumb rubber modified asphalt binder did well in terms of bonding strength, natural rubber latex modified asphalt binder performed well in terms of resistance to shear. Overall, both rubberized modified binders performed better than the control sample. |(C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For this purpose, bacterial mortars with cells concentration of 10(3), 10(5) and 10(7) cells/ml were prepared. Calcium lactate was used as the organic precursor at dosages of 1%, 3%, and 5% of cement weight. The mechanical, durability, crack healing, and microstructural characteristics of the bacterial mixes were examined and compared to those of the control mix. The results indicated that incorporating bacterial cells with concentration of 10(5) cells/ml treated with 1% calcium lactate led to the optimal mix. The 28-day compressive strength of the optimal mix increased by 21% over that of the control mix. The lowest water absorption was also recorded for this mix, which was about 7% lower than that of the control mix. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the optimal mix showed a dense and compact microstructure as a result of calcite precipitation, which filled the air voids and reduced the pore size. Increasing the calcium lactate content lowered the quality of the pore system due to overproduction of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) crystals. This was confirmed by the results of porosimetry test using mercury injection method where the sample prepared with 5% calcium lactate and bacterial concentration of 10(3) cells/ml showed 450% higher total porosity as compared to the control sample. On the other hand, crack healing analysis revealed that the maximum healing in surface cracks occurred at the maximum bacterial concentration and calcium lactate content. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the soaring demand for tires and vehicles, disposing of WTTFs imposes a heavy burden on the environment mainly because of two reasons: i) they occupy massive valuable space in landfills, and ii) burning them leads to dangerous gas emission. In this research, the feasibility of reusing WTTFs as reinforcement agents in an expansive soil was investigated through a comprehensive set of laboratory experiments, i.e. standard compaction, Split Tensile Strength (STS), swelling-consolidation, volumetric shrinkage, and desiccation cracking tests. According to the results, WTTFs can enhance all of the investigated geotechnical characteristics of the expansive soil. Moreover, it was proven that WTTF-expansive soil mixtures can be used as a suitable material for impermeable liners and covers in landfills. Therefore, instead of burying or burning them, WTTFs can be competently employed as reinforcement materials in expansive soils. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Narani, S.

J	Jin, YF; Yin, ZY				Jin, Yin-Fu; Yin, Zhen-Yu			An intelligent multi-objective EPR technique with multi-step model selection for correlations of soil properties	ACTA GEOTECHNICA			English	Article; Early Access						Artificial intelligence; Compressibility; Multi-objective optimization; Permeability; Robustness; Undrained shear strength	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; FINE-GRAINED SOILS; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; COMPRESSION BEHAVIOR; MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; SHEAR-STRENGTH; PERMEABILITY RELATIONSHIPS; ENGINEERING PROPERTIES; CONSTITUTIVE MODEL; GENETIC ALGORITHM	Current multi-objective evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR) methodology has difficulties on decision-making of optimal EPR model. This paper proposes an intelligent multi-objective optimization-based EPR technique with multi-step automatic model selection procedure. A newly developed multi-objective differential evolution algorithm (MODE) is adopted to improve the optimization performance. The proposed EPR process is composed of two stages: (1) intelligent roughing model selection and (2) model delicacy identification. In the first stage, besides two objectives (model accuracy and model complexity), the model robustness measured by robustness ratio is considered as an additional objective in the multi-objective optimization. In the second stage, a new indicator named selection index is proposed and incorporated to find the optimal model. After intelligent roughing selection and delicacy identification, the optimal EPR model is obtained considering the combined effects of correlation coefficient, size of polynomial terms, number of involved variables, robustness ratio and monotonicity. To show the practicality of the proposed EPR technique, three illustrative cases helpful for geotechnical design are presented: (a) modelling of compressibility, (b) modelling of undrained shear strength and (c) modelling of hydraulic conductivity. For each case, a practical formula with better performance in comparison with various existing empirical equations is finally provided. All results demonstrate that the proposed intelligent MODE-based EPR technique is efficient and effective.

In this study, the digital image processing (DIP) technique is used to obtain the real aggregate and mortar distribution of recycled concrete specimens. By applying the DIP MATLAB model, the real mesoheterogeneity of RAC is well represented. Based on the base force element method (BFEM), a mesomechanical model is constructed to simulate the uniaxial tension and compression tests of recycled concrete specimens subjected to displacement loads. The damage and the cracking mechanisms of RAC are analyzed in the mesolevel. Moreover, the failure process and the failure mode are investigated. Results indicate the nonlinearity deformation, stress redistribution, and cracks propagation of RAC. The stress-strain curve, fracture energy, and fracture distribution are also figured. The comparative analysis between the simulation and the experimental results of in situ RAC samples shows the applicability of the model; therefore, the failure mechanism is revealed. It also extends the application of the BFEM in the field of failure mechanism analysis of RAC as a heterogeneous composite material.	[Peng, Yijiang; Ying, Liping; Kamel, Mahmoud M.

We proposed a novel stabilized node-based smoothed radial point interpolation method (SNS-RPIM) to analyze the free vibration and the behavior of functionally graded magnetoelectro-elastic (FGMEE) devices under mechanical and thermal load, which cured the 'overly-soft' and temporally instability of traditional NS-RPIM. The gradient variance items associated with the field nodes are applied to construct the system stiffness matrix. The detailed numerical study has shown the superiority of the proposed method. SNS-RPIM performs well in solving static magneto-electro-thermo-elastic (METE) multi-physics coupling field problems, which validates the accuracy, convergence of the proposed method. Moreover, SNS-RPIM is less insensitive to mesh distortion than FEM and NS-RPIM. The advantages mentioned above make SNS-RPIM very helpful for the design of the actual intelligent devices.

The computed SOECs have been used to determine the temperature dependent specific heat, thermal energy density, elastic coupling constants, Gruneisen parameters, ultrasonic velocities, Debye average velocity, ultrasonic attenuation, and thermal relaxation time. We have observed that the temperature dependent ultrasonic attenuation and thermal relaxation time for HfX2 are mainly affected by thermal conductivity. The elastic properties of the material are compared with existing data in literature for the validation of the work. The obtained values of elastic stiffness are found very large in comparison to that of other material from transition metal dichalcogenides of group IVB indicating better mechanical properties than the same group materials. Calculated elastic, thermal, and ultrasonic properties are correlated for better characterization of the materials which are useful for thermoelectric and energy transport applications.

However, the incorporation of construction waste should be well examined without compromising the performance. There are few studies focusing on applying construction waste in pervious concrete. This study was aimed at exploring the feasibility of reusing recycled aggregate from construction waste for open-graded cement stabilized macadam (OGCSM) and evaluating its performance. Various replacement ratios of recycled aggregate ranging from 0% to 100% were designed and studied in the OGCSM. The performance of OGCSM containing recycled aggregate are comprehensively evaluated. Specifically unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test, indirect tensile strength (ITS) test, compression resilience modulus test, dry shrinkage test, frost resistance test, and permeability test were conducted. As the results showed, the UCS, ITS and compression resilience modulus of OGCSM decreased with the increase of replacement ratios of recycled aggregate. Dry shrinkage performance also declined with the increase of recycled aggregate content while permeability performance increased with the increase of recycled aggregate content. The UCS after freeze-thaw cycles declined with the increase of recycled aggregate content and cycles. However, there was no significant correlation between residue strength rate and recycled aggregate content. When the replacement ratio was 30%, the residue strength rate was maximum. Although the performance of OGCSM declined with the increase of recycled aggregate content, it could be potentially used in the base of the highway when the performance of OGCSM containing appropriate amount of recycled aggregate met the requirement of base layer of pavements.

In the present study, bacteria were immobilized via recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) and virgin fine aggregate (FA) besides direct induction to preserve natural resources and emulate sustainability. The application of RCA in substitution of virgin coarse aggregate is dropping anthropogenic emissions, minimizing energy consumption and managing construction waste effectively. Vegetative cells of Bacillus subtilis bacterium were incorporated in RCA through vacuum impregnation to boost crack healing efficiency. Crack healing efficiency was studied by quantifying the crack healing widths and percentage of strength regained after pre-cracking at 3,7 and 28 days. Similarly, mechanical properties were gauged via compressive and split tensile strengths at specified intervals while healing precipitate was characterized using analytical means. Results of experimental work revealed that specimens having RCA and 50% virgin FA as bacteria immobilizers exhibited the most efficient crack healing remedy by healing crack widths up to 1.1 mm and recovering 85% of compressive strength. Specimens containing RCA exclusively displayed a maximum of 0.7 mm crack healing widths and 76% strength recovery while direct incorporation of bacteria lagged behind with 0.6 mm crack healing width having 69% strength recovery. Likewise, synergetic formulation and direct induction depicted increase in compressive strength of 4% and 6% respectively while exclusive RCA formulation decreased the compressive strength up to 3% Moreover, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescent (XRF) characterized the crack healing precipitate as bio-mineralized calcite crystals.

The two-layer experimental model were composed of 12 unit curtain walls, of which there are 2 beams at a distance of 1.2 m from the top and bottom in 9 unit curtain walls respectively, and there is only one beam at a distance of 1.2 m from the top in 3 unit curtain walls. The dimension of each unit curtain wall is 1.2 m x 4.0 m. The section shape of the experimental model is L-shaped. Firstly, the experimental investigation and analysis of the model with arrangement of one pair of hooks under positive and negative wind were carried out. Secondly, the experimental investigation and analysis of the model with no hooks under positive and negative wind were carried out. The out-of-plane deformation, in-plane deformation and the strain of the columns were collected and analyzed. Finally, finite element analysis model was established. The similarities and differences of the analysis results and the experimental results were analyzed. The results show that the beam has a small constraint on the columns whether the wind pressure is positive or negative when the number and position of hooks are reasonable. When the wind pressure is negative, the hook has little effect on the out-of-plane deformation and stability. Under the action of positive wind, the hooks can significantly reduce the in-plane deformation and restrain the lateral torsion deformation of the columns.

Two-, four- and six-layered glass fiber reinforced polyester resin polymer matrix composites were prepared using the hand-layup technique. The magnetorheological fluid was prepared in-house with 30% volume of carbonyl iron powder and 70% volume of silicone oil. Nine cantilever sandwich beams of varying thicknesses of the top and bottom layers glass fiber reinforced polyester resin polymer matrix composite beams and middle magnetorheological fluid core were prepared. The magnetorheological fluid core was activated with a non-homogeneous magnetic field using permanent magnets. The first three modes, natural frequencies and damping ratios of the glass fiber reinforced polyester resin polymer matrix composite-magnetorheological fluid core sandwich beams were determined through free vibration analysis using DEWESoft modal analysis software. The amplitude frequency response of the glass fiber reinforced polyester resin polymer matrix composite-magnetorheological fluid core sandwich beams through forced vibration analysis was determined using LabVIEW. The effect of various parameters such as magnetic flux density, thickness of glass fiber reinforced polyester resin polymer matrix composite layers and magnetorheological fluid core layer on the natural frequencies, damping ratio and vibration amplitude suppressions of the glass fiber reinforced polyester resin polymer matrix composite-magnetorheological fluid core sandwich beams was investigated. Based on the results obtained, 2 mm thickness top and bottom layers glass fiber reinforced polyester resin polymer matrix composite and 5 mm thickness magnetorheological fluid core sample have achieved a high shift in increased natural frequency, damping ratio and vibration amplitude suppression under the influence of magnetic flux density.

This study aims to develop a stochastic multiphase micromechanical framework with Legendre orthogonal polynomial to investigate the unbiased probabilistic behavior of the fiber-reinforced concrete's moduli. The different phase volume fractions are analytically calculated based on the aggregate grading and the material's effective properties are quantitatively reached by employing the multilevel micromechanical homogenization schemes. The Monte Carlo simulations are adopted to attain the different order moments of fiber-reinforced concrete's effective properties, with which the unbiased probability density functions are reached by using the Legendre orthogonal polynomial approximations and the linear transformations. Numerical examples indicate that the proposed framework is accurate and computationally efficient to characterize the fiber-reinforced concrete's probabilistic behavior.	[Liu, X.

The primary objective of this research was to examine the aerodynamic performance of the main cable in construction phases and to develop appropriate countermeasures to eliminate the potential wind-induced vibrations. Two cross-sections with different shapes of a main cable were chosen, and a series of wind tunnel tests were performed in a reduced wind velocity range of 32-366 using elastically mounted sectional models. Galloping occurred for the two cross-sections under certain wind incidence angles when a critical velocity was reached. No obvious hysteresis phenomenon of galloping was observed in the tests. The steady amplitude of galloping increased linearly with wind velocity and the increasing rate almost kept constant for different structural damping ratios. The aerodynamic nonlinearity, rather than the structural damping nonlinearity, is the main source leading to the limited amplitude oscillation. An empirical expression of galloping amplitudes for the two cross-sections was derived based on the test data. Meanwhile, the critical wind velocity was studied in a Scruton (Sc) number range of 108-4196 (as varied by changing the initial structural damping ratio between 0.093% and 3.62%). Results showed that the Den Hartog criterion was applicable to forecast the possibility of galloping, but not able to estimate the critical wind velocity for the main cable. Linear fitting method can be used to predict the critical velocity based on the experimental data. Finally, three vibration mitigation measures were studied, and a combination of structural and aerodynamic measures was recommended for galloping mitigation of main cables. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To express the mathematical relationship between dependent and independent parameters, nonlinear regression and soft computing techniques including multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), gene expression programming (GEP) and group method of data handling (GMDH) were utilized. To find out the most effective parameters on TE, analyzing the Gamma Test (GT) and reviewing the structures of GMDH, MARS and GEP were performed. The accuracy of empirical formula derived based on the nonlinear regression with (R-2 = 0.65 and RMSE - 15.17) was inappropriate. Evaluating the performances of GMDH, GP and MARS with regarding calculation of standard error indices such as (R-2 and RMSE) indicated that all of them with minimum value of R-2 = 0.95 and maximum value of RMSE = 5.79 have suitable accuracy for modeling and predicting the TE. However, the MARS model is a bit more accurate than the others. Results of GT and reviewing the structure of prepared models (GMDH, MARS and GP) declared that ratio of volume of flood to volume of sediments (V-F/V-S), ratio of mean diameter of sediment size to the volume of flood (D-50/(3)root V-F) and specific gravity (G(s) = gamma(s)/gamma(w)) are the most effective parameters on T-E.

Double cantilever beam specimen is chosen for our numerical evidence purpose. The analysis consists of two main phases namely, generation and application (prediction) phases. In the generation phase, the dynamic stress intensity factors of propagating and arrested cracks are estimated by the present formulation for given crack path histories, and a good agreement is achieved. As for the application phase, dynamic stress intensity factors as well as total crack lengths after crack arrests are in good agreement with the experiments. Moreover, the influence of transition bond concept on the crack arrest behavior is investigated and it is found that the transition bond is very efficient in the simulation of the crack arrest problem such that premature arrests of cracks are observed without transition bond cases.

However, when signal propagation is hindered, serious errors, non-line-of-sight errors, occur. In order to solve this problem, this article proposes an improved particle filter algorithm, which introduces the idea of residual analysis to improve reliability. The algorithm assigns weights to the particles based on the residuals and selects the appropriate particles. In addition, the non-line-of-sight error parameter a is introduced, and the second selection is made according to a, which considers the influence of non-line-of-sight error. The non-line-of-sight error is greatly reduced after two selections. The simulation is performed under several different non-line-of-sight errors, and results show that the algorithm is superior to Kalman filter and particle filter.

Furthermore, measures for the structural improvement for better fluidity and higher wear resistance are proposed based on the analysis results from DEM accordingly. Firstly, the flow characteristics of particles inside the chamber was obtained through investigation of velocity field, motion trajectory and mass flow rate. Secondly, the abrasion loss on cutterhead and the maximum tunneling distance without changing tools was predicted. Thirdly, through particle-structure interaction (PSI) analysis, the stress and deformation information about cutterhead in a quasistatic state was output. Fourthly, on-site measured data indicate that the power supply device can fulfill the requirement of thrust force and cutterhead torque. Finally, the strength, abrasion loss and internal pressure of screw conveyor were checked. Overall, the selected chamber system shows a satisfactory performance. Furthermore, the proposed improvement measures were verified through DEM simulation, which can provide references for further optimization design of shield chamber.

The pavement texture structure changes due to traffic and environmental conditions during the pavement service life. Pavement surface polishing and Filling the pavement hollows due to contamination can change the texture structure. In this research, using image processing, the pattern of the filling pavement hollows has been investigated. Then, using the numerical model, the way of the effect of filled parts on the skid resistance has been determined. The MTD of different pavements after 15 months has decreased 14-22%, as a result of this reduction, the skid number has decreased 8-18%. In the various pavements, 5-16% of decreasing in mean texture depth and 8-12% of the decreasing in skid number, is due to filling the pavement hollows. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the use of roller-compacted concrete pavement (RCCP) in road problems is widespread. The compressive strength (f(c)) is the key characteristic of the RCCP caused to significant impact on the cost of production. In this study, an evolutionary-based algorithm named gene expression programming (GEP) is implemented to propose novel predictive formulas for the f(c) of RCCP. The f(c) is formulated based on important factor used in mixture proportion in three different combinations of dimensional form (coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, cement, pulverized fly ash, water, and binder), non-dimensional form (water to cement ratio, water to binder ratio, coarse to fine aggregate ratio and pulverized fly ash to binder ratio) and percentage form of input variables. A comprehensive and reliable database incorporating 235 experimental cases collected from several studies. Furthermore, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (r), average absolute error (AAE), performance index (PI), and objective function (OBJ) as the internal standard statistical measures and external validation evaluated proposed GEP-based models. Uncertainty and parametric studies were carried out to verify the results. Moreover, sensitivity analysis to determine the importance of each predictor on f(c) of RCCP revealed that fine aggregate content and water to binder ratio is the most useful predictor in dimensional, non-dimensional and percentage forms, respectively. The proposed equation-based models are found to be simple, robustness and straightforward to utilize, and provide consequently new formulations for f(c) of RCCP. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The structures of prepared novel photoinitiators were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high resolution MS (HR-MS) spectra data. The photo chemical behavior and photo-reactivity were also evaluated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and real-time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (RT-FTIR), respectively. The results show the prepared photoinitiators exhibit remarkable redshift compared to the commercial BP (benzophenone) and Irgacure 907 (2-methyl-1-(4-methylsulfanylpheny1)-2-morpholin-4-ylpropan-1-one), fast photolysis by C-S bond, good photo initiation and significant overcoming oxygen inhibition for some compounds, which can be used as one-component photoinitiator candidates.

The numerical model was verified based on a well-instrumented large-scale test. A 3-D soil arch model was proposed for pile caps in a triangular pattern, in which the crown of the upper boundary was approximately 1.4 times the clear spacing of pile caps. Inclusion of geosynthetic reinforcement reduced the soil arching effect but increased the total load carried by the piles. For the case with three geosynthetic layers, the lower layer had a significant effect on load transfer than the middle and upper layers, but each layer had an almost proportional effect on mitigating the differential sett on the top of the gravel cushion. The maximum strains in the reinforcement concentrated on the geosynthetic strips bridging over two adjacent square cap corners.

Numerical evaluation of secondary reinforcement effect on geosynthetic-reinforced retaining walls	GEOTEXTILES AND GEOMEMBRANES			English	Article						Geosynthetics; Deformation; Geosyntbetic-reinforced retaining wall; Numerical simulation; Secondary reinforcement; Tensile stress	COMPACTION-INDUCED STRESS; SIMULATION; BEHAVIOR	A finite difference method was employed to evaluate the effect of secondary reinforcement on the performance of Geosynthetic-Reinforced Retaining (GRR) walls. The two-dimensional numerical models used a Cap-Yield soil constitutive model to represent the behavior of backfill. The numerical model was first calibrated and verified by the measured results from a full-scale field test. A parametric study was then performed to investigate the effects of secondary reinforcement length, secondary reinforcement stiffness, secondary reinforcement connection, and secondary reinforcement layout. The numerical results show that an increase in secondary reinforcement length and stiffness can reduce the deflection of the GRR wall and the maximum tensile stress of primary reinforcement. The mechanical connection of secondary reinforcement can also reduce the wall facing deflection and result in relatively small maximum tensile stress and connection stress in the primary reinforcement as compared with no connection to the secondary reinforcement. In addition, a wall with fewer but longer secondary reinforcement layers at certain elevations had relatively smaller wall facing deflections than the baseline case. This comparison demonstrates that more optimal layout of secondary reinforcement exists that could further reduce the maximum wall facing deflections and create a better performing wall while the same or less amount of geosynthetic reinforcement material is used.

J	Yusuf, F; Micovic, Z				Yusuf, Faizal; Micovic, Zoran			Prototype-Scale Investigation of Spillway Cavitation Damage and Numerical Modeling of Mitigation Options	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING			English	Article							DYNAMICS; FLOW	This paper documents a prototype-scale investigation of cavitation damage to a newly resurfaced spillway being used operationally during phased construction work to replace all piers and radial gates. Initial concrete damage on the right abutment spillway steps occurred in December 2015 as a result of over 300 h of continuous spilling from a new spillway gate. No cavitation damage had been observed on the original spillway constructed in the 1930s. Factors that contributed to the cavitation damage for this spillway are reviewed, including the duration of continuous spill and the increased cavitation potential of both a smooth concrete surface compared to one that is uniformly rough and sharp-edged steps compared to steps with rounded edges. Continued spilling through 2016 exacerbated concrete damage to the spillway steps leading to an experimental interim measure of constructing a tetrahedron concrete wedge to reduce the magnitude of flow separation and mitigate material loss in the location of greatest damage. Although damage to the steps continued to progress with ongoing spilling, the concrete wedge was successful in reducing the extent of damage at that location. A numerical model was calibrated by comparing simulated pressures to observed concrete damage allowing a long-term cavitation mitigation option to be designed with increased minimum pressures of approximately 50% and greater at the spillway steps compared to the 2015 as-built geometry.

In this study, we explored the role of four nanocarbon materials as NFs, namely, graphene nano-platelets (GNP) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) and their hydrophilic derivatives, graphene oxide (GO) and functionalized CNT (f-CNT), respectively. We investigated how the NF dimensionality and hydrophilicity affect the various properties of NF-cement composites in fresh (e.g., workability) and hardened (e.g., strength) states. This will enable one to judiciously choose an appropriate NF for a specific application. In that respect, the additive polycarboxylate ether (PCE) is employed both as a surfactant for the NF dispersion in the cementitious matrix and as a superplasticizer, reducing the composite mixture viscosity to enhance its workability. The addition of GO, CNT or f-CNT fillers (in the presence of 0.2 wt% PCE) demonstrated workability deterioration for all NF concentrations while that of the GNP-loaded system was much less affected. Among the four explored NE-loaded systems, GO (0.025 wt%) was the best reinforcing agent with enhancement of 60% in flexural and similar to 30% in compressive strengths. Nevertheless, GNP presents a cost-effective alternative, although a little inferior to GO in its mechanical performance. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanical characteristics and differential settlement of the foundation are the main problems studied in high-speed railway research. The mechanical characteristics and differential settlement of the foundation are greatly affected by the ground treatment. Additionally, the effects of train load and earthquakes have a great impact. The dynamic action of the train will increase the vibration acceleration of the foundation and increase the cumulative deformation, and the earthquake action will affect the stability of the substructure. Earthquakes have an important practical significance for the dynamic analysis of the railway operation stage; therefore, considering the impact of earthquakes on the railway substructure stability has engineering significance. In this paper, finite element model of the CFG (Cement Fly-ash Gravel) pile + cement-soil compacted pile about composite foundation is established, and manual numerical incentive method is selected as the simulation principle. The mechanical characteristics and differential settlement of CFG pile + cement-soil compacted pile about composite foundation under train load are studied. The results show: under the train load, the neutral point of the side friction about CFG pile is located at nearly 7/8 of the pile length; the vertical dynamic stress-time history curves of the cement-soil compacted pile, CFG pile and soil between piles are all regular serrated shape, the vertical dynamic stress of CFG pile changes greatly, but the vertical dynamic stress of cement-soil compacted pile and soil between piles does not change much; the vertical displacement of CFG pile, cement-soil compacted pile and soil between piles change very little.

The key mechanisms include the following: (1) designing the upper and lower corbel-shaped temporary support columns, (2) crack repairing the inner steel pipe using patch-shaped steel plates, and (3) replacing microwound concrete inside the steel pipe, which are all innovative and effective methods. Moreover, a system is developed for monitoring the safety during the reinforcement process and recovering the bearing capacity of the concrete-encased CFST column. The monitoring results indicate that the load conversion process of the temporary support columns lasts for 50 days, that the sum of the axial forces of the four supporting columns is 7,966.0 kN, accounting for 65% of the standard load, and that during the whole process, the structural components are safe and reliable. Finally, the construction simulation is in agreement with the field test results, which proves that the construction simulation developed based on the theory of slow time-dependent mechanics and the method of static nonlinear analysis is accurate.

The steel design method of ARCP was developed to eliminate unnecessary steel bars in CRCP and the crack induction strategies of ARCP were accomplished to provide even better pavement performance. The numerical analyses, laboratory experiments, and field experiments were conducted to confirm the concept of ARCP, to find the most appropriate design of ARCP, and to validate ARCP finally. Details of the efforts to develop ARCP are comprehensively presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CSM was prepared by replacing natural limestone aggregate with MSWI BA in different proportions (0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%). The physical properties, chemical properties, and micro-morphology of MSWI BA were studied to explore the mechanism of MSWI BA aggregate in CSM. The mechanical properties (unconfined compressive strength, cleavage strength, compressive resilience modulus), drying shrinkage, freezing resistance, and leaching behavior of CSM were tested. The results showed that MSWI BA had low density, low strength, high water absorption, high porosity, hydraulicity, and cementitious activity. Substitution of MSWI BA for natural limestone reduced the unconfined compressive strength, the cleavage strength, and the compression modulus of resilience of CSM, but these parameters still met the requirements of the specification. The CSM containing MSWI BA had higher cumulative water loss rate and smaller average dry shrinkage coefficient than traditional CSM. Adding 0-20% MSWI BA reduced the cumulative dry shrinkage strain of CSM. The residual strength ratio of CSM increased slightly at first and then decreased rapidly, and the CSM containing 0-30% MSWI BA met the freezing resistance requirements of semi-rigid base materials. The leaching concentration of heavy metals of CSM curing 7 days with 30% MSWI BA was still far below the limit of Chinese standard GB 5085.3. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Xu, G; Li, AQ				Xu, Gang; Li, Aiqun			Experimental and numerical studies on the lateral performance of concrete sandwich walls	STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF TALL AND SPECIAL BUILDINGS			English	Article; Early Access						numerical simulation; parametric analysis; sandwich wall; seismic performance; quasi-static test	SEISMIC BEHAVIOR; SHEAR WALLS	A series of quasi-static tests was presented to study the lateral behavior of concrete sandwich walls and the precast concrete sandwich walls; the finite element analysis (FEA) models were built for numerical simulation of the specimens, and the parameters affecting the seismic performance of sandwich walls, and the precast sandwich walls were also analyzed based on the FEA models. The results show that the shear failure occurs in regular squat shear wall; the setting of the foam plate effectively reduces the stiffness and load capacity, and the reasonable design of sandwich region is conducive to the seismic performance. The responses obtained by the FEA models match well with the experimental results. The stiffness and load capacity of sandwich wall are increased, but the ductility is reduced when the axial load is increased; the deformation capacity can be greatly improved by increasing the aspect ratio but at the cost of load capacity and stiffness; the reasonable match of load capacity, stiffness, and ductility can be achieved by maintaining the appropriate length and thickness of the foam plate. The greater the friction force of CAF in the vertical seam of precast sandwich wall, the greater the load capacity and initial stiffness and the stronger the integrity of the jointed wall. When the strength of SRS in the horizontal seam is small, the concrete sandwich wall basically maintains elasticity; the deformation is mainly concentrated on SRS; when the strength of SRS is too large, SRS do not yield or the yield displacement is large, and the load capacity is mainly affected by the concrete sandwich wall.

Preservation treatments considered in the analysis include thin overlay, chip seal, and crack seal that are typically used by highway agencies. At construction stage, there are significant differences in emissions caused by various preservation treatments mainly due to different raw material components and manufacturing processes. At use stage, fuel consumptions vary significantly depending on tire rolling resistance that is affected by pavement surface characteristics. The Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions at the use stage were predicted using the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) and pavement roughness models obtained from Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) program. The results show that pavement preservation brings significant environmental benefit in reduction of CO2 emission due to the improved pavement surface condition despite the emission generated at construction stage. Thin overlay produces the highest life-cycle reduction in CO2 emission due to the large International Roughness Index (IRI) jump after treatment; while crack seal has the lowest reduction of CO2 emission. The optimum application timing of preservation treatment was determined for chip seal and thin overlay assuming one-time treatment applied before reaching the IRI threshold.

In order to explore specific changes in coarse aggregate morphology, the Los Angeles abrasion test was used to simulate the force exerted on coarse aggregates and the morphologies of different aggregates before and after abrasion were compared. Four types of coarse aggregates were selected and their mineral compositions were analyzed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The morphological characteristics were measured using Aggregate Image Measurement System (AIMS-?), including angularity, surface texture, sphericity and Flat and Elongation (F and E) ratio. Results showed that the angularity value for each type of aggregates significantly reduced after abrasion and the angularity reductions of various aggregates were consistent with the results of abrasion test, indicting the angularity reduction was the main component of abrasion loss. Whereas, there was no significant different between the surface texture of coarse aggregates before and after abrasion. For shape properties, both sphericity and F and E ratio results showed that aggregates with excessively high F and E ratio were easy to break, which might cause rutting and were harmful to pavement. Therefore, for pavements with high performance requirement, coarse aggregates with large angularity and low abrasion value should be preferred, whereas the quantity of particles with excessively high F and E ratio should be controlled.

Cup-shaped concrete specimens with water/cement (w/c) ratios of 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 were fabricated. During the 270 days corrosion time, corrosion behavior on concrete surfaces was observed every 30 days. The extent of damage on concrete was calculated on the basis of the results of periodic ultrasonic testing. After the completion of experiments, X-ray fluorescence analysis was conducted on the element contents at different depth locations of partial specimens. Experimental results showed that hydraulic pressure accelerated the sulfate attack on concrete, and high pressure yielded serious damage. In comparison with zero pressure, the accelerating coefficients of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 MPa hydraulic pressures were 1.48, 1.75, and 2.35, respectively. Hydraulic sulfate corrosion can bring additional sulfate ions into concrete and cause chemical and physical sulfate corrosions on concrete simultaneously, thereby resulting in serious damage on concrete. The reduction of w/c ratio and incorporation of fly ash are beneficial for concrete to resist hydraulic sulfate attack.

Asphalt pavement analyzer (APA) is one such multi-functional sophisticated equipment. Wearing course layers are primarily attributable to be deteriorated by rutting distress in flexible asphalt pavements. Therefore, 30 representative wearing course mixtures commonly used in road pavements were tested for rutting distress using APA. Mixtures were evaluated based on their rutting performance and found that consistent ranking has been observed at temperature conditions of 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C. It was observed that APA rut depth could be effectively modelled using statistical techniques of multiple non-linear regression and artificial neural network. Novel aggregate material indices designated as 'aggregate source index' and 'aggregate gradation index' were developed in this study. Based on past literature; temperature, aggregate source index (ASI), aggregate gradation index, bitumen penetration values, and number of APA loading cycles/strokes were included as independent variables in the model developed for selected asphalt mixtures. It has been concluded from the values of non-linear regression parameters that temperature has the highest significance for rut depth prediction, followed by the bitumen penetration value, ASI, aggregate gradation index and number of loading cycles. Statistical parameters i.e. coefficient of determination, root mean squared error, values account for, and mean absolute percentage error showed that the artificial neural network technique better predicts the APA rut depth as compared to multiple non-linear regression techniques.

The mechanical behavior of CFRP as an anode has been investigated in some solution environments. However, the anodic and mechanical behavior of CFRP bonded to concrete is unclear. This paper focuses on the anodic and mechanical performance of CFRP bonded to the chloride-contaminated concrete by conducting an electrochemical (EC) test. The method of bonding the CFRP to the concrete and the shape of the steel embedded in the concrete were considered. The current densities of 20 mA/m(2) and 100 mA/m(2) were applied during 120-day and 310-day EC tests. The electrode potentials and driving voltages were recorded, and the bond interfaces of the CFRP were inspected after EC test. The residual tensile strength and failure modes of the CFRP were analyzed after tensile tests. Finally, the long-term performance of CFRP as a dual-functional material in ICCP-SS system was discussed. Results show that the externally bonding CFRP in ICCP-SS system can not only protect the steel in chloride-contaminated concrete effectively but also maintain 70% of the original tensile strength of CFRP at a charge density of 744 A<bold>h</bold>/m(2). The expected service period of CFRP as a dual-functional material bonded to the chloride-contaminated concrete was determined to be more than 42.5 years.

However, the strain rate behavior of 500 MPa-grade anti-earthquake hot-rolled high-strength ribbed bar (HRB500E), used in critical RC members to improve the anti-earthquake performance, has not been investigated and reported in the open literature. That restricts its application in RC structures subjected to extreme dynamic loads. In this paper, dynamic tensile tests of HRB500E steel were conducted using an electromechanical universal testing machine and a servo-hydraulic high-speed testing machine. The stress-strain curves at strain rates ranging from 0.00025 to 550 s(-1) were obtained where HRB500E steel was found significantly sensitive to strain rate. Existing formulations to evaluate the dynamic increase factor for yield stress (DIFy) are found to be not suitable for HRB500E steel, thus the widely used Cowper-Symonds and Malvar models for predicting the DIFy were modified based on the test results. Furthermore, the parameter of the Mander material model for describing engineering stress-strain relationship was also calibrated. Finally, the Johnson-Cook and proposed constitutive models for the true stress-strain relationship were examined. The proposed constitutive model can provide better prediction accuracy for yield stress than the Johnson-Cook model.

Structural control of RC buildings subjected to near-fault ground motions in terms of tuned mass dampers	SCIENTIA IRANICA			English	Article						Structural control; Tuned mass damper; Passive; Near-fault earthquake	VIBRATION ABSORBERS; OPTIMIZATION; EXPRESSION; PLACEMENT	To design a proper structure against earthquake in modern systems, control systems are of special importance. An added passive Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) is one of such systems, which will be discussed in this paper. In this regard, the effect of adding this damper to a 10-floor concrete structure under six near-fault earthquakes is investigated. To do this, a code has been written in MATLAB that receives the ground motion record of occurring earthquake as well as the structural specifications such as a matrix of mass, stiffness, and damping as an input. As outputs, a time-history of responses for the top floor, a diagram for the floor displacement, and drift, of the structure at the time that the top floor has reached the maximum displacement are presented. In addition, these diagrams are compared both when the added damper is present and absent. It is observed that the added passive control of TMD is highly effective in the reduction of structure response against earthquake, which in turn depends on the properties of the earthquake and, therefore, should be chosen based on the site seismic conditions.

Coal consumption in thermal plants generates huge quantity of pond ash thus, requires an alternative mode of ash disposal. In this study, attempt has been made to evaluate different geotechnical properties of OB-pond ash mix at various proportions. Effect of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) on compaction characteristics, shear strength parameters, California bearing ratio (CBR) and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) value at different curing period has been presented. It was found that mix proportion containing 78% OB, 10% pond ash, and 12% GGBFS exhibited maximum UCS and CBR value at 28 days curing period. Stability analyses of dump composed of different proportions of OB material, pond ash, and GGBFS were carried out using numerical modelling to suggest the suitable dump profile. It was observed from numerical modelling that dump profile of 60.0 m height and 32 degrees slope angle can be suitably adopted for all mix proportions. Based on the various input parameters, empirical model and multiple regression model have been developed to predict the CBR value and factor of safety respectively. Significance of various input parameters were analysed using sensitivity analysis and found that slope angle is highly sensitive parameters.

There are several mixture design technologies that can be used to reduce concrete shrinkage and subsequent cracking. The main focus of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of three such technologies to limit restrained shrinkage cracking in a scaled laboratory bridge deck. The first mixture evaluated shrinkage compensating cement (Type-K) as a partial replacement of Portland cement, the second mixture evaluated pre-wetted lightweight fine aggregate as a partial replacement of fine aggregate to promote internal curing (IC), and finally, the third evaluated a mixture incorporating shrinkage reducing admixture (SRA). Strain of the deck reinforcement was monitored during and after placement of the concrete for a period of 6 months. All of the data was compared with similar measurements from a control deck containing a standard concrete mixture used by the Illinois Department of Transportation. The results showed that, the experimental deck containing Type-K cement exhibited around 100% higher expansion compared to control mixture during the curing period. The IC mixture showed approximately 50% less expansion at 7 days but exhibited 10% less shrinkage at the end of drying period compared to the control mixture. The initial expansion of SRA mixture showed similar peak value compared to control mixture but at the end of the drying period, the shrinkage of SRA mixture was around 75% less than the deck cast with control mixture.

Seismic response of a highway bridge in case of vehicle-bridge dynamic interaction	EARTHQUAKES AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						vehicle-bridge interaction; recursive solution of coupled equation; far-field near-field earthquake motion; highway bridges; sprung-mass vehicle models	SOIL-STRUCTURE; NEAR-FAULT; FAR-FIELD; SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; DAMAGE	The vehicle-bridge interaction (VBI) analysis might be cumbersome and computationally expensive in bridge engineering due to the necessity of solving large number of coupled system of equations. However, VBI analysis can provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of highway bridges under specific loading conditions. Hence, this paper presents a numerical study on the dynamic behavior of a conventional highway bridge under strong near-field and far-field earthquake motions considering the VBI effects. A recursive substructuring method, which enables solving bridge and vehicle equations of motion separately and suitable to be adapted to general purpose finite element softwares, was used. A thorough analysis that provides valuable information about the effect of various traffic conditions, vehicle velocity, road roughness and effect of soil conditions under far-field and near-field strong earthquake motions has been presented. A real-life concrete highway bridge was chosen for numerical demonstrations. In addition, sprung mass models of vehicles consist of conventional truck and car models were created using physical and dynamic properties adopted from literature. Various scenarios, of which the results may help to highlight the different aspects of the dynamic response of concrete highway bridges under strong earthquakes, have been considered.

Even though these wind structures are exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as strong winds and tides, few previous studies have focused on this issue. This study proposes a damage-identification method to detect structural damage occurring near the bottom of the monopile offshore wind structures using data fusion of acceleration and angular velocity responses. Traditional damage-detection methods have utilized a single type of measurement such as acceleration or strain; however, the proposed method is based on the combination of two different types of measurement to significantly improve the damage-detection threshold. A damage sensitivity index is proposed that is a function of the energy ratios between the acceleration and angular velocity responses at each natural mode. Both numerical simulations and laboratory-scale experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed damage-detection method when applied to a monopile offshore wind structure.

Energy behavior assessment of rice husk fibres reinforced polymer composite	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-JMR&T			English	Article						Energy; Fatigue failure; Natural fibre; Rice husk	NATURAL FIBER; FATIGUE BEHAVIOR; LIFE; DISSIPATION; HYSTERESIS; STRENGTH; EPOXY	Natural fibre composites, possess characteristics that are beneficial towards the environment and ecosystem, completely biodegradable, renewable, offer strength and reliability of the material properties, and enhance economic development because of its ability in replacing synthetic composites. One of them refers to rice husk, which is a non-timber source that is easily available from agricultural wastes. Hence, rice husk fibres were selected as fibre-reinforced composites, while polypropylene as matrices in this research. Rice husk composite (RHC) specimens were produced via injection molding process. The composite composition was fixed at 35% of fibre content. The cycle tests were conducted to obtain cyclic properties by adhering to specifications outlined in ASTM D3479. Servo-hydraulic machines were used for five different stresses with constant amplitudes of R=0.1, R = 0.3, and R= 0.5 of S75, S80, S85, S90, and S95 to determine the stress effects on energy dissipation and fatigue life of the material. The results indicated that there was increment in energy loss for the increasing fatigue life in every cycle. This shows that with the addition of natural fibres in composites, the material exhibited viscoelastic behaviour, in which energy loss was represented by matrix cracks and broken fibres.

Moreover, versatile construction procedures can be utilised to improve construction efficiency, because the steel plates can function as a framework during concrete casting. Recent studies have shown that there are multiple shear mechanisms in SCSBWs, and the shear resistance of these structures deserves further investigation to achieve more rational designs. Based on previous experimental and theoretical studies, numerical investigations are carried out in this study to investigate the shear resistance of an SCSBW, and an elaborate three-dimensional nonlinear finite element method (FEM) model is proposed. Based on this elaborate FEM model, a series of analyses are conducted to investigate the loading process, stress development, concrete cracking, stress state, and interfacial behaviour of SCSBWs under shear. Mutual verifications are obtained between results of the FEM model, experiments, and theory. Based on the analysis of the interfacial properties, the FEM model is simplified, and the simplified model is shown to be accurate and efficient. Further, parametric analyses are conducted, revealing that the concrete, axial web, flanges, and shear-span ratio have a significant influence on the shear resistance. Finally, a modified theoretical method is proposed to consider the influences of dowel action and small shear-span ratios, with which the accuracy of predicting the shear resistance of SCSBWs can be improved.

The IMMLS-C approach uses reproducing conditions to establish an equivalence between MLS shape functions and isogeometric basis functions. The advantages of this approach include the exact geometry representation, convenient crack modeling and flexible adaptive refinement. The IMMLS-C approach focuses on solving fracture problems based on strong formulations without requiring the numerical integration of Galerkin weak forms. Traction-free boundary conditions are enforced over a set of collocation points located on both sides of a crack surface. The displacement discontinuity along the crack surface is modeled by the visibility criterion and the singularity of near-tip stress fields is captured by adaptive mesh refinement without adding tip-enrichment functions, thereby reducing the degrees of freedom compared with the extended finite element method. Moreover, contact constraints are enforced by introducing a penalty algorithm to the strong formulations. The numerical results demonstrate that the adaptive refinement is able to achieve a high convergence rate at a low computational cost.

Until now, limited studies have been contributed to this topic. To investigate the geo-hazards and explore the associated failure mechanism due to tunnel leaking, both experimental test and comprehensive numerical simulations using the validated finite-difference-method and discrete-element-method (FDM-DEM) coupling method were carried out in this study. It was disclosed that displacements of the sand stratum surrounding the leaking tunnel could be divided into three regions (erosion, displacement, and static zones) by two ellipsoids; the stress changes caused by seepage erosion around the leaking tunnel were similar to that observed by the active door test. Finally, a stress arching model accounting for seepage erosion around a leaking tunnel was proposed. This model can help professionals evaluate stability of overburdening strata by giving soil stress distributions in sand formation surrounding a leaking tunnel with seepage erosion.

J	Li, WD; Nhon, NT; Huang, JZ; Zhou, K				Li, Weidong; Nhon Nguyen-Thanh; Huang, Jiazhao; Zhou, Kun			Adaptive analysis of crack propagation in thin-shell structures via an isogeometric-meshfree moving least-squares approach	COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Adaptivity; Isogeometric analysis; Meshfree method; Reproducing formulation; Crack propagation; Thin shell	FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD; NONLINEAR-ANALYSIS; FRACTURE-ANALYSIS; GROWTH; PLATES; REFINEMENT; SIMULATION; GEOMETRY; NURBS; METHODOLOGY	This paper reports an isogeometric-meshfree moving least-squares approach for the adaptive analysis of crack propagation in thin-shell structures within the context of linear elastic fracture mechanics. The present approach is developed based on the equivalence of the moving least-squares meshfree shape functions and the isogeometric basis functions, which provides an effective strategy of adaptive mesh refinement for isogeometric analysis (IGA) in a straightforward meshfree manner. The adaptivity of the mesh refinement is achieved by utilizing a gradient-based error estimator to identify the meshes that need to be refined by adding linear reproducing points. The Kirchhoff-Love theory is further applied in the isogeometric-meshfree moving least-squares formulation to simplify the modeling of cracked thin-shell structures by neglecting the rotational degrees of freedom. In this way, the singularity of stress fields near the crack tip and the discontinuity of displacement fields around the crack surface can be efficiently captured by the adaptive mesh refinement to generate accurate results. A series of twodimensional static and quasi-static crack propagation problems of thin-shell structures are investigated. It is found that the adaptive refinement strategy makes the present approach achieve higher convergence rate and computational efficiency than IGA and the meshfree method. The predicted propagation paths obtained by the present approach are in good agreement with the previously reported results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To achieve this, three-dimensional numerical simulations for vertical, inclined, and round backward facing step inside a horizontal rectangular duct are established. The effects of variation in buoyancy, viscous and inertia forces variations as well as the step shape, on thermal and hydrodynamic behaviours of the fluid are investigated. The structure of the flow is significantly influenced by the variation of Bingham and Richardson numbers and the backward facing steps shape. It is found that the recirculation zones, which are the main source of thermal and hydrodynamic losses, are intensified with the increase in buoyancy forces represented by the Richardson number. Moreover, the recirculation zones are attenuated as the viscous forces predominate. It is also noticed that the recirculation zones decrease or disappear as the geometry is modified by reducing the angle or the shape of the step. The change of the step shape reduces significantly the pressure drops of about 11.77% and 58.83% for the inclined and rounded backward facing steps; respectively, compared to the vertical backward facing step. However, the pressure coefficient decreases along the duct and increases in presence of a recirculation zone. Also, the highest value of the total Nusselt number is obtained for a round backward facing step in mixed convection. Otherwise, an increase in the Bingham number extends the plug structure in the three geometries.

Some of these projects are constructed in shale formations with anisotropic thermal/mechanical properties, which affect the thermal cracking behavior. It is therefore imperative to understand and correctly model the thermo-mechanical (TM) coupling behavior of anisotropic shale rocks for better and safer designs. In this paper, a novel anisotropic TM coupled model, named as Y-TManiso, is proposed to study the heat transfer and thermal cracking process in the anisotropic shale formations based on the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM). In particular, some inherent characteristics of the shale formations (e.g., material anisotropy, preexisting discontinuities and multiple layers) can be well handled in this model. The performance of this model on temperature field calculation and thermal cracking modelling are confirmed by numerical tests with analytical or experimental solutions. An application test concerned with the thermal cracking in a shale formation is investigated. The results show that the proposed Y-TManiso has implications in the application and design of TM coupling problems in anisotropic shale formations.

J	Wang, BM; Fan, CC				Wang, Baomin; Fan, Chengcheng			Comparative Study on Dispersion of Carbon Nanofibers and Enhancement on Mechanical Property and Microstructure in Cement Composites	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Dispersion; Carbon Nanofiber; Cement Composite; Microstructure; Morphology	ELASTIC-MODULUS; PERFORMANCE; NANOTUBES; INDENTATION; HARDNESS; SENSORS	Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) could not be distributed evenly in cement composites due to their high specific surface area and van der Waals force, and the poor dispersion of CNFs significantly influenced the performance of cement composites. Therefore, uniform dispersion of CNFs plays a significant role in the properties of cement composites. This study mainly investigated the cement composite samples with CNFs treated respectively by methyl cellulose (MC), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and MC+SDS. The UV-vis spectroscopy and optical microscopy results showed that the dispersion of CNFs in the MC+SDS solution was much better than that in MC and SDS solution. MC, SDS and MC+SDS solution improved the mechanical properties of CNFs reinforced cement composites, but the MC+SDS solution exhibited the greatest effect. Furthermore, the microstructure and morphology analysis indicated that uniform dispersed CNFs could accelerate the hydration process and phase formation, and improved the compactness and interfacial connection, so as to enhance the mechanical properties and microstructure of cement composites.
