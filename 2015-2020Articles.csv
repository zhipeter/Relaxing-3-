In this study, four data-driven models, namely multiple linear regression, artificial neural network, adaptive neural fuzzy inference system, and K nearest neighbor models based on collection of 207 laboratory tests, are investigated for compressive strength prediction of concrete at high temperature. In addition for each model, two different sets of input variables are examined: a complete set and a parsimonious set of involved variables. The results obtained are compared with each other and also to the equations of NIST Technical Note standard and demonstrate the suitability of using the data driven models to predict the compressive strength at high temperature. In addition, the results show employing the parsimonious set of input variables is sufficient for the data driven models to make satisfactory results.

A weakly singular boundary integral equation method together with the near-front approximation is adopted to accurately determine the intensity factors. Obtained results indicate that the non-flat crack surface, the electric field, and the permittivity of a medium inside the crack gap play a crucial role on the behavior of intensity factors. The mode-I stress intensity factors (K-I) for two representative non-planar cracks under different crack-face conditions are found significantly different and they possess both upper and lower bounds. In addition, K-I for impermeable and semi-permeable non-planar cracks treated depends strongly on the electric field whereas those of impermeable, permeable, and semi-permeable penny-shaped cracks are identical and independent of the electric field. The stress/electric intensity factors predicted by permeable and energetically consistent models are, respectively, independent of and dependent on the electric field for the penny-shaped crack and the two representative non-planar cracks. Also, the permittivity of a medium inside the crack gap strongly affects the intensity factors for all crack configurations considered except for K-I of the semi-permeable penny-shaped crack.

Studies have been carried out investigating the engineering properties and possible applications of these fibers. However, the experimental methods employed and the values of mechanical and physical properties recorded by various authors are inconsistent. It has therefore become necessary to organize information which would be useful in the design of oil palm fiber cement composites and help researchers and engineers make informed decisions in further research and application.

This study investigated the self-healing and interface properties of crumb rubber modified asphalt (CRMA) using thermodynamic parameters based on the molecular simulation approach. The molecular models of CRMA were built with representative structures of the virgin asphalt and the crumb rubber. The aggregate was represented by SiO2 and Al2O3 crystals. The self-healing capability was evaluated with the thermodynamic parameter wetting time, work of cohesion and diffusivity. The interface properties were evaluated by characterizing the adhesion capability, the debonding potential and the moisture susceptibility of the asphalt-aggregate interface. The self-healing capability of CRMA is found to decrease as the rubber content increases. The asphalt-Al2O3 interface with higher rubber content has stronger adhesion and moisture stability. But the influence of crumb rubber on the interfacial properties of asphalt-SiO2 interface has no statistical significance. Comparing with the interfacial properties of the asphalt-SiO2 interface, the asphalt-Al2O3 interface is found to have a stronger adhesion but a worse moisture susceptibility for its enormous thermodynamic potential for water to displace the asphalt binder.

The focus of the present contribution is two fold. One of the objectives is to investigate the applicability of polyethylene fittings in joining polyethylene gas pipes which are electrofused onto the pipe ends and buried under the ground, by estimating stress distribution using finite element method. The second objective is to study the effectiveness of polyethylene repair patches which are used to mend the defected pipelines by performing a finite element analysis to calculate peak stress values. Buried polyethylene pipelines in the natural gas industry, can be imposed by sever loadings including the soil-structure interaction, traffic load, soil's column weight, internal pressure, and thermal loads resulting from daily and/or seasonal temperature changes. Additionally, due to the application of pipe joints, and repair patches local stresses superimposed on the aforementioned loading effects. The pipe is assumed to be made of PE80 resin and its jointing socket, and the repair patch is PE100 material. The computational analysis of stresses and the computer simulations are performed using ANSYS commercial software. According to the results, the peak stress values take place in the middle of the fitting and at its internal surface. The maximum stress values in fitting and pipe are below the allowable stresses which shows the proper use of introduced fitting is applicable even in hot climate areas of Ahvaz, Iran. Although the buried pipe is imposed to the maximum values of stresses, the PE100 socket is more sensitive to a temperature drop. Furthermore, all four studied patch arrangements show significant reinforcing effects on the defected section of the buried PE gas pipe to transfer applied loads. Meanwhile, the defected buried medium density polyethylene gas pipe and its saddle fused patch can resist the imposed mechanical and thermal loads of 22 degrees C temperature increase. Moreover, increasing the saddle fusion patch length to 12 inches reduces the maximum stress values in the pipe, significantly.

With this study, along with the conventional methods of simple and multiple linear regression models, three machine learning algorithms, random forest, gradient boosting and stacked models, are developed for prediction of undrained shear strength. These models are employed on a relatively large data set from different projects around Turkey covering 230 observations. As an improvement over the available studies in literature, this study utilizes correct statistical analyses techniques on a relatively large database, such as using a train/test split on the data set to avoid overfitting of the developed models. Furthermore, the validity and consistency of the prediction results are ensured with the correct use of statistical measures like p-value and cross-validation which were missing in previous studies. To compare the performances of the models developed in this study with the prior ones existing in literature, all models were applied on the test data set and their performances are evaluated in terms of the resulting root mean squared error (RMSE) values and coefficient of determination (R-2). Accordingly, the models developed in this study demonstrate superior prediction capabilities compared to all of the prior studies. Moreover, to facilitate the use of machine learning algorithms for prediction purposes, entire source code prepared for this study and the collected data set are provided as supplements of this study.

The objective of pretest analysis was to obtain an insight on the seismic response of the bridge model during the shake table tests. The bridge included seat type abutments, full-depth precast deck panels, and a two-column bent in which columns were pinned to the footing and integral with superstructure. Six accelerated bridge construction connections were incorporated in the bridge model. An analytical model was developed in OpenSees and was subjected to ten input bi-directional earthquake motions including near-fault and far-field records. The overall seismic response of the bridge was satisfactory for all the earthquake records at 100%, 150%, and 200% design level. All connections and capacity-protected components remained elastic, and the average ductility capacity surpassed the ductility demand even at 200% design level. Using experimental fragility curves developed for RC bridge columns, it was predicted that there was a probability of 45% that columns would undergo the imminent failure in the last run and a probability of 30% for their failure.

Several studies have been conducted to understand the behavior of these types of foundations, which are often used for uniform loading on the raft and piles with the same length, while generally the transition load from the upper structure to the foundation is non-uniform and the choice of uniform length for piles in the above model will not be optimally economic and practical. The most common method in identifying the behavior of piled rafts is the use of theoretical relationships and software analyses. More precise identification of this type of foundation behavior can be very difficult due to several influential parameters and interaction of set behavior, and it will be done by doing time-consuming computer analyses or costly full-scale physical modeling. In the meantime, the technique of artificial neural networks can be used to achieve this goal with minimum time consumption, in which data from physical and numerical modeling can be used for network learning. One of the advantages of this method is the speed and simplicity of using it. In this paper, a model is presented based on multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network. In this model pile diameter, pile length, and pile spacing is considered as an input parameter that can be used to estimate maximum settlement, maximum differential settlement, and maximum raft moment. By this model, we can create an extensive domain of results for optimum system selection in the desired piled raft foundation. Results of neural network indicate its proper ability in identifying the piled raft behavior. The presented procedure provides an interesting solution and economically enhancing the design of the piled raft foundation system. This innovative design method reduces the time spent on software analyses.

However, due to repetitive wind loads, cyclic fatigue stresses are induced and they are the primary source of failure in welded connections at these locations. The resistance of fatigue critical details has been an on-going research topic because of limited experimental results and the variability in existing fatigue testing results. The main objective of this study is to evaluate fatigue resistance of fillet-welded tube connection details by utilizing the advanced fatigue tool in ANSYS Workbench platform. Finite Element (FE) models development and model validation using existing test data was presented. The resulting fatigue resistance from FE analysis was expressed in terms of fatigue life, fatigue damage, and fatigue safety factor to determine the fatigue performance of fillet-welded connections. Existing fatigue test data was grouped to perform a synthetic analysis and then analysis results were provided to determine input data and fatigue limit for the fatigue module. The local stress level at fatigue critical locations was evaluated using a static FE model for different number of stiffeners and boundary conditions. The results of this investigation provides fatigue resistance of fillet-welded connection details in the form of fatigue life, fatigue damage and safety factor for various connection parameters and structural conditions.

Fourteen out of 16 carbonated specimens had been subjected to realkalization seven years ago, and the alkalinity of the concrete, the electrochemical characters (corrosion current density and potential) of the specimens and the corrosion conditions of the steel bars were examined. Results of different specimens and also at different time (4, 10, 13 months and 7 years after realkalization) were compared. According to the phenolphthalein and pH meter test, the alkalinity of the concrete had disappeared after seven years. Based on the potentiodynamic polarization test, various corrosion conditions had developed on the steel bars, which was verified by visual observation. All bars were in the depassivated state, and their corrosion current densities increased significantly after seven years.

In this research paper, we have dedicated three certain and four uncertain design factors to quantify their rational effects using numerical simulations and the Sobol's sensitivity indices. Main effects and interaction effects between the design factors have been determined supporting on variance-based global sensitivity analysis. The results detected that the concrete modulus of elasticity for the tunnel lining has the greatest effect on the tensile damage generation in the tunnel lining during the seismic action. In the other direction, the interactions between the concrete density and both of concrete modulus of elasticity and tunnel diameter have appreciable effects on the tensile damage. Furthermore, the tunnel diameter has the deciding effect on the stability of the tunnel structure. While the interaction between the tunnel diameter and concrete density has appreciable effect on the stability process. It is worthy to mention that Sobol's sensitivity indices manifested strong efficiency in detecting the roles of each design factor in cooperation with the numerical simulations explaining the responses of the circular tunnel during seismic actions.

J	Shishegaran, A; Ghasemi, MR; Varaee, H				Shishegaran, Aydin; Ghasemi, Mohammad Reza; Varaee, Hesam			Performance of a novel bent-up bars system not interacting with concrete	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						bending capacity; rubber tube; stress transfer; bent-up bars; ductility; cracking	MESHFREE METHOD; RC BEAMS; FRACTURE; SHEAR; FRP; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN; PLATES	Increasing the bending and shear capacities of reinforced concrete members is an interesting issue in structural engineering. In recent years, many studies have been carried out to improve capacities of reinforced concrete members such as using post and pre-tensioning, Fiber Reinforced Polymer and other techniques. This paper proposes a novel and significant technique to increase the flexural capacity of simply supported reinforced concrete beams. The proposed method uses a new reinforcement bar system having bent-up bars, covered with rubber tubes. This technique will avoid interaction of bent-up bars with concrete. They are located in the zone where compressive and tensile forces act against one another. The compressive force in the upper point of the bent-up bars is exerted to the end point of these bars located under neutral axis. Moreover, the tensile stress is decreased in reinforcements located under the neutral axis. This will cause the Reinforced Concrete (RC) beam to endure extra loading before reaching yield stress. These factors may well be considered as reasons to increase bending capacity in the new system. The laboratory work together with finite element method analysis were carried out in this investigation. Furthermore, bending capacity, ductility, strength, and cracking zone were assessed for the new proposed system and compared with the conventional model. Both the FEM simulation and the experimental test results revealed that the proposed system has significant impact in increasing the load bearing capacity and the stiffness of the RC beams. In the present study, an equation is formulated to calculate bending capacity of a new reinforcement bar system beam.

The stiffness test of filament wound composite pipes is simulated using cohesive zone method. The modeling is accomplished to study the effect of the geometrical parameters including delamination size and its position with respect to loading direction on stiffness of the composite pipes. At first, finite element results for stiffness test of a perfect pipe without delamination are validated with the experimental results according to ASTM D2412. It is seen that the finite element results agree well with experimental results. Then the finite element model is developed for composite pips with delaminated areas with different primary shapes. Thus, the effect of the size of delaminated region on longitudinal and tangential directions and also its orientation with respect to loading direction on delamination propagation and stiffness reduction of the pipes is assessed.

To investigate the shear strength of SRC frame columns strengthened with CFRP sheets, experimental observations on eight seismic-damaged SRC frame columns strengthened with CFRP sheets were conducted at Yangtze University and existing experimental data of 49 SRC columns are presented. Based on the existing experiments, the theories of damage degree, zoning analysis of concrete, and strengthening material of the column are adopted. To present the expression formula of the shear strength of SRC frame columns strengthened with CFRP sheets, the contributions of strengthening material and transverse reinforcement to shear strength in the truss model are considered, based on the truss-arch model. The contribution of arch action is also considered through the analysis of the whole concrete and that of the three zones of the concrete are also considered. The formula is verified, and the calculated results are found to match well with the experimental results. Results indicate that the proposed whole analysis model can improve the accuracy of shear strength predictions of shear seismic-damaged SRC frame columns reinforced with CFRP sheets.

An attempt has been made to scrutinize the properties of HFRC with the main concentration being on energy absorption characteristics of concrete and the efficacy of fiber hybridization in producing synergy. Accordingly, a total of 180 specimens, representing 20 different mixtures have been cast and evaluated through compressive, split tensile, and flexural tests. The relevant flexural toughness of the specimens was calculated using ASTM C1018, ASTM C1609, JSCE, and PCS methods, and the effectiveness of these methods was evaluated based on the experimental results. It was observed that steel fibers are more effective in the improvement of flexural toughness in the presence of PP fibers. Furthermore, synergy associated with the combination of fibers at different stages of deflection of the beam specimens was observed and analyzed.

Numerical simulations with three different models of pressure time history generated by underwater explosion were carried out. The first model of pressure time history was measured in test. The second model to predict the time history of shock wave pressure from an underwater explosion was created by Cole in 1948. Coefficients of Cole's formulas are determined experimentally. The third model was developed by Zamyshlyaev and Yakovlev in 1973. All of them are implemented into the numerical model to calculate the shock responses of the plate. Simulated peak strains obtained from the three models are compared with the experimental results, yielding average relative differences of 21.39%, 45.73%, and 13.92%, respectively. The Russell error technique is used to quantitatively analyze the correlation between the numerical and experimental results. Quantitative analysis shows that the simulated strains for most measurement points on the steel plate are acceptable. By changing the scaled distances, different shock impulses were obtained and exerted on the steel plate. Systematic numerical studies are performed to investigate the effect of the accumulated shock impulse on the peak strains. The numerical and experimental results suggest that the peak strains are strongly dependent on the accumulated shock impulse.

This study investigates the efficiency and feasibility of six machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, back-propagation neural network, wavelet neural network, general regression neural network (GRNN), extreme learning machine, support vector machine and random forest (RF), to predict tunneling-induced settlement. Field data sets including geological conditions, shield operational parameters, and tunnel geometry collected from four sections of tunnel with a total of 3.93 km are used to build models. Three indicators, mean absolute error, root mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination the (R-2) are used to demonstrate the performance of each computational model. The results indicated that ML algorithms have great potential to predict tunneling-induced settlement, compared with the traditional multivariate linear regression method. GRNN and RF algorithms show the best performance among six ML algorithms, which accurately recognize the evolution of tunneling-induced settlement. The correlation between the input variables and settlement is also investigated by Pearson correlation coefficient.

This paper focused on the development of a LSSVM model to predict the M-r of recycled materials for pavement applications and comparison with other different models such as Regression, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Blends of Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) with Recycled Clay Masonry (RCM) with proportions of 100/0, 90/10, 80/20, 70/30, 55/45, 40/60, 20/80, and 0/100 by the total aggregate mass were evaluated for use as UGMs. RCA/RCM materials were collected from dumps on the sides of roads around Mansoura city, Egypt. The investigated blends were evaluated experimentally by routine and advanced tests and the M-r values were determined by Repeated Load Triaxial Test (RLTT). Regression, ANN, and LSSVM models were utilized and compared in predicting the M-r of the investigated blends optimizing the best design model. Results showed that the M-r values of the investigated RCA/RCM blends were generally increased with the decrease in RCM proportion. Statistical analyses were utilized for evaluating the performance of the developed models and the inputs sensitivity parameters. Eventually, the results approved that the LSSVM model can be used as a novel tool to estimate the M-r of the investigated RCA/RCM blends.

It is shown that the evaluation of base stabilities of excavation pits against seepage failure by using Terzaghi and Peck's approach leads to considerably lower critical potential differences than those obtained from the model tests. On the other hand, a relatively good agreement is achieved between the results of the model tests and the finite element (FE) analyses. Further investigations are performed by using axisymmetric excavation models with various dimensions and ground conditions, and a comparison between the results obtained from Terzaghi and Peck's approach and finite element analyses is given.

In this paper, a dimensionless Pressure-Impulse (P-I) diagram was constructed as a convenient tool to predict the damage level of curved SCS sandwich shell subjected to uniformly distributed blast loading. The curved SCS sandwich shell was equivalent to a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system and the equation of motion was established by employing the Lagrange's equation. To construct the dimensionless P-I diagram, the energy balance method was utilized to yield the pressure and impulse asymptotes and the responses in the dynamic response regime were obtained via employing the SDOF method.

Effect of wood dust type on mechanical properties, wear behavior, biodegradability, and resistance to natural weathering of wood-plastic composites	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						wood-plastic composites; mechanical testing; wear; biodegradability; injection molding; weathering	STOCHASTIC PREDICTIONS; POLYPROPYLENE COMPOSITES; OUTDOOR APPLICATIONS; POLYMER COMPOSITES; SURFACE-CHEMISTRY; FIBER COMPOSITES; POLYETHYLENE; SAWDUST; FLOUR; FLAX	The present work reports the inclusion of different proportions of Mango/Sheesham/Mahogany/Babool dust to polypropylene for improving mechanical, wear behavior and biodegradability of wood-plastic composite (WPC). The wood dust (10%, 15%, 20% by weight) was mixed with polypropylene granules and WPCs were prepared using an injection molding technique. The mechanical, wear, and morphological characterizations of fabricated WPCs were carried out using standard ASTM methods, pin on disk apparatus, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Further, the biodegradability and resistance to natural weathering of WPCs were evaluated following ASTM D5338-11 and ASTM D1435-99, respectively. The WPCs consisting of Babool and Sheesham dust were having superior mechanical properties whereas the WPCs consisting of Mango and Mahogany were more wear resistant. It was found that increasing wood powder proportion results in higher Young's modulus, lesser wear rate, and decreased stress at break. The WPCs made of Sheesham dust were least biodegradable. It was noticed that the biodegradability corresponds with resistance to natural weathering; more biodegradable WPCs were having the lesser resistance to natural weathering.

This paper describes the performance of saline soil treatment using electrokinetic remediation technology. Comparison study involving sample soil and in situ soil is carried out. Two different electric fields, i.e., uniform and non-uniform are utilized to promote the migration of inorganic ions contained in the soil toward the electrode area. The effects of different electric field types and potential gradient ion migration rate in soil are investigated. The test result reveals that a uniform electric field of a constant potential gradient of 1 V/cm drives the Cl- through the sample soil at a rate of 1.36 cm/h. Moreover, larger potential gradients could make ions migrate faster, but more electrical energy is consumed in such a way. Compared with uniform electric field, the non-uniform process maintains the soil pH values more effectively and consumes less electrical energy. A desirable result of removing Na+ in soil is expected using electrokinetic remediation technology under four-times scaling up of soil volume.

However, the E-modulus and strength of such members at high service temperatures is still unknown. Modulus and strength of FRP at high service temperatures are highly required parameters for full design. The knowledge and application of this could lead to a cost effective and practical consideration in fire safety design. Thus, this paper proposes design methods for calculating the E-modulus and strength of FRP members at different temperatures. Experimental data from literature were normalized and compared with the results predicted by this method. It was found that the proposed design methods conservatively estimate the E-modulus and strength of FRP structural members. In addition, comparison was also made with direct references to the real behavior of materials. It was found to be satisfactory. Finally, an application is provided.

SSI model for a 12 storied building frame, supported on pile foundation-soil system, is developed in the finite element based software framework, OpenSEES. Three different structure-foundation configurations are analyzed under different ground motion characteristics. Lateral extent of soil domain, along with the soil properties, were varied exhaustively for a particular structural configuration. Based on the reduction in the variation of acceleration response at different locations in the SSI system (quantified by normalized root mean square error, NRMSE), the optimum lateral extent of the soil domain is prescribed for various structural widths, soil types and peak ground acceleration levels of ground motion. Compared to the past studies, error estimation analysis shows that the relationships prescribed in the present study are credible and more inclusive of the various factors that influence SSI. These relationships can be readily applied for deciding upon the lateral extent of the soil domain for conducting precise SSI analysis with reduced computational time.

J	Rezaiee-Pajand, M; Estiri, H				Rezaiee-Pajand, Mohammad; Estiri, Hossein			Finding buckling points for nonlinear structures by dynamic relaxation scheme	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						load factor; external work; dynamic relaxation; static equilibrium path; large displacement	POSTBUCKLING ANALYSIS; LARGE DEFLECTION; ELEMENT; FORM; LOAD; TRUSS; SNAP; SENSITIVITY; FORMULATION; FRAMEWORK	Dynamic Relaxation Method (DRM) is an explicit approach for solving the simultaneous systems of equations. In this tactic, the fictitious mass and damping are added to the static governing equations, and an artificial dynamic system is constructed. By using DRM for nonlinear analysis, the structural static equilibrium path is obtained. This outcome is extremely valuable, since it leads to the behavior of structures. Among the finding related to the structural static path are the critical and buckling points for nonlinear structures. In this paper, a new way for calculating the load factor is proposed by setting the external work zero. Mixing the dynamic relaxation scheme with external work technique has not been formulated so far. In all incremental-iterative methods, the load factor increment sign should be determinated by extra calculations. This sign leads to increase or decrease of the load increment. It is worth emphasizing that sign of the load factor increment changes at the load limit points. Therefore, the sign determinations are required in the common work control methods. These disadvantages are eliminated in the proposed algorithm. In fact, the suggested load factor depends only on the Dynamic Relaxation (DR) fictitious parameters. Besides, all DR calculations are performed via vector operation. Moreover, the load factor is calculated only by one formula, and it has the same relation in the all solution processes. In contrast to the arc length techniques, which requires the sign determined, the proposed scheme does not need any sign finding. It is shown that author's technique is quicker than the other dynamic relaxation strategies. To prove the capability and efficiency of the presented scheme, several numerical tests are performed. The results indicate that the suggested approach can trace the complex structural static paths, even in the snap-back and snap-through parts.

In this paper, CNTs were synthesized on Ni catalyst/fly ash substrate using CVD method. The influence of parameters (e.g., reaction temperature and gas flow rate) on the carbon yield and structure of the resulting CNTs was on the carbon yield and structure of the resulting CNTs was investigated by thermo-gravimetric analyses, Scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy analysis. The results indicated that the growth temperature controlling had a significant effect on the diameter of CNTs. And the proper acetylene and hydrogen flow rate would decrease in defect density and increase in yield of as-grown CNTs on fly ash. Finally, the amorphous carbon on the surface of as-grown CNTs were removed by heating in air. Experimental results showed that the hydrophobic of the annealed CNTs was weak due to introducing functional groups to the surface of CNTs.

However, there are multiple sources of uncertainties in the seismic design process that can affect desired performance predictability. This paper mainly focuses on the effects of near-fault pulse-like ground motions and the uncertainties in bridge modeling on the seismic demands of regular continuous highway bridges. By modeling a regular continuous bridge with OpenSees software, a series of nonlinear dynamic time-history analysis of the bridge at three different site conditions under near-fault pulse-like ground motions are carried out. The relationships between different Intensity Measure (IM) parameters and the Engineering Demand Parameter (EDP) are discussed. After selecting the peak ground acceleration as the most correlated IM parameter and the drift ratio of the bridge column as the EDP parameter, a probabilistic seismic demand model is developed for near-fault earthquake ground motions for 3 different site conditions. On this basis, the uncertainty analysis is conducted with the key sources of uncertainty during the finite element modeling. All the results are quantified by the "swing" base on the specific distribution range of each uncertainty parameter both in near-fault and far-fault cases. All the ground motions are selected from PEER database, while the bridge case study is a typical regular highway bridge designed in accordance with the Chinese Guidelines for Seismic Design of Highway Bridges. The results show that PGA is a proper IM parameter for setting up a linear probabilistic seismic demand model; damping ratio, pier diameter and concrete strength are the main uncertainty parameters during bridge modeling, which should be considered both in near-fault and far-fault ground motion cases.

Investigation on modeling parameters of concrete beams reinforced with basalt FRP bars	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						basalt Fiber-reinforced polymer bars; reinforced concrete beams; finite element analysis; damaged plasticity model; design codes	CONTINUUM DAMAGE MODELS; PLASTICITY MODEL; COMPRESSION	Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars are widely used as internal reinforcement replacing the conventional steel bars to prevent from corrosion. Among the different types of FRP bars, basalt FRP (BFRP) bars have been used in different structural applications and, herein, three already tested concrete beams reinforced with BFRP bars are analyzed using three-dimensional (3-D) finite element analysis (FEA). The beams were tested in four-point bending. In the FEA the behavior of concrete is simulated using the "Concrete-Damaged Plasticity" model offered in ABAQUS software. The research presented here presents a calibrated model for nonlinear FEA of BFRP concrete beams to predict their response considering both the accuracy and the computational efficiency. The calibration process showed that the concrete model should be regularized using a mesh-dependent characteristic length and material-dependent post-yield fracture and crushing energies to provide accurate mesh-size independent results. FEA results were compared to the test results with regard to failure load and crack patterns. Both the test results and the numerical results were compared to the design predictions of ACI 440.1R-15 and CSA S806-12, where CSA S806-12 seems to overestimate the shear strength for two beams.

Two important questions need to be answered during such an excavation. First, how should the grouting size be determined? Second, when should excavation begin after grouting? These two questions are conventionally addressed through empirical experience and standard criteria because a reliable quantitative approach, which would be preferable, has not yet been developed. To address these questions, we apply a recently proposed numerical approach known as discontinuity layout optimization, an efficient node-based upper bound limit analysis method. A case study is provided utilizing a tunnel located in a stratum characterized by complicated geological conditions, including soft soil and a fault zone. The factor of safety is used to quantitatively assess the stability of the tunnel section. The influences of the grouted zone thickness and the time-dependent material properties of the grouted zone on the stability of the tunnel section are evaluated, thereby assisting designers by quantitatively assessing the effects of pre-grouting.

The results show that, in addition to the truss and strut-and-tie mechanisms, the confinement mechanism also existed in the joint core. A certain amount of stirrup is not only able to enhance the confinement in joint core, undertake a part of shear force and thus to increase the shear capacity, prevent the outward buckling of steel bars in column, improve the stress distribution in joint core, delay cracking and restrain the propagation of cracks, but also to increase the yield load, decrease the yield displacement of beam and improve the joint ductility. However, excessive horizontal stirrups contribute little to the joint performance. In a certain range, larger axial compression ratio is beneficial for the joint mechanical behavior, while it is negative when axial compression ratio is too large.

The parameters are: tunnel lining thickness, tunnel diameter, tunnel lining concrete modulus of elasticity and tunnel lining concrete density. Monte-Carlo sampling method is dedicated to construct the meta models so that to be used for the BCQO method using matlab codes. Numerical simulations of the tensile damage in the tunnel lining due to a real earthquake in the literature are created for three design cases. XFEM approach is used to show the cracks for the mentioned design cases. The results of the BCQO method for the maximum design case for the tunnel tensile damage was matching the results obtained from XFEM approach to a fair extent. The new coupled approach manifested a significant capability to predict the cracks and spalling of the tunnel lining concrete under the effects of dynamic earthquakes.

J	Shishegaran, A; Ghasemi, MR; Varaee, H				Shishegaran, Aydin; Ghasemi, Mohammad Reza; Varaee, Hesam			Performance of a novel bent-up bars system not interacting with concrete	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						bending capacity; rubber tube; stress transfer; bent-up bars; ductility; cracking	MESHFREE METHOD; RC BEAMS; FRACTURE; SHEAR; FRP; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN; PLATES	Increasing the bending and shear capacities of reinforced concrete members is an interesting issue in structural engineering. In recent years, many studies have been carried out to improve capacities of reinforced concrete members such as using post and pre-tensioning, Fiber Reinforced Polymer and other techniques. This paper proposes a novel and significant technique to increase the flexural capacity of simply supported reinforced concrete beams. The proposed method uses a new reinforcement bar system having bent-up bars, covered with rubber tubes. This technique will avoid interaction of bent-up bars with concrete. They are located in the zone where compressive and tensile forces act against one another. The compressive force in the upper point of the bent-up bars is exerted to the end point of these bars located under neutral axis. Moreover, the tensile stress is decreased in reinforcements located under the neutral axis. This will cause the Reinforced Concrete (RC) beam to endure extra loading before reaching yield stress. These factors may well be considered as reasons to increase bending capacity in the new system. The laboratory work together with finite element method analysis were carried out in this investigation. Furthermore, bending capacity, ductility, strength, and cracking zone were assessed for the new proposed system and compared with the conventional model. Both the FEM simulation and the experimental test results revealed that the proposed system has significant impact in increasing the load bearing capacity and the stiffness of the RC beams. In the present study, an equation is formulated to calculate bending capacity of a new reinforcement bar system beam.

The incorporated uncertainties, which are defined as random variables, are associated with the most affecting structural (material) properties of concrete and thermal loading conditions. Karaj arch dam is selected as case study. The dam is numerically modeled along with its foundation in three-dimensional space; the temperature and thermal stress distribution is investigated during the operating phase. The deterministic thermal finite element analysis of the dam is combined with the structural reliability methods in order to obtain thermal response predictions, and estimate the probability of failure in the risk analysis context. The tensile overstressing failure mode is considered for the reliability analysis. The thermal loading includes ambient air and reservoir temperature variations. The effect of solar radiation is considered by an increase in the ambient temperatures. Three reliability methods are employed: the first-order second-moment method, the first-order reliability method, and the Monte-Carlo simulation with Latin Hypercube sampling. The estimated failure probabilities are discussed and the sensitivity of random variables is investigated. Although most of the studies in this line of research are used only for academic purposes, the results of this investigation can be used for both academic and engineering purposes.

The PTSC connection is comprised of bolted top and bottom angles as energy dissipaters and steel strands to provide self-centering capacity. The FE analysis has also been validated against the experimental test. The new formulations derived from analytical method has been proposed to predict bending moment of PTSC connections. The web-post buckling in hexagonal castellated beams has been identified as the dominant failure mode when excessive initial post-tensioning force is applied to reach greater bending moment resistance, so it is required to limit the highest initial post-tensioning force to prevent this failure. Furthermore, properties of steel material has been simulated using bilinear elastoplastic modeling with 1.5% strain-hardening which has perfectly matched with the real material of steel angles. It is recommended to avoid using steel angles with high yielding strength since they lead to the yielding of bolt shank. The necessity of reinforcing plates to prevent beam flange from local buckling has been reaffirmed.

Three kinds of errors, as volume expansion, stress vibration, and attenuation of angular velocity, were observed in the original NMM. The first two kind errors are owing to the small deformation assumption and the last one is due to the numerical damping. A large deformation NMM is proposed based on large deformation theory. In this method, the governing equation is derived using Green strain, the large deformation iteration and the open-close iteration are combined, and an updating strategy is proposed. The proposed method is used to analyze block rotation, beam bending, and rock falling problems and the results prove that all three kinds of errors are eliminated in this method.

The Tikhonov method is adapted by a newly-proposed detector based on the MINMOD limiters and the grids are adapted by the multiresolution analysis (MRA) via interpolation wavelets. Hence, both small and large magnitude physical waves are preserved by the adaptive estimations on non-uniform grids. Due to developing of non-dissipative spurious oscillations, numerical stability is guaranteed by the Tikhonov regularization acting as a post-processor on irregular grids. To preserve waves of small magnitudes, an adaptive regularization is utilized: using of smaller amount of smoothing for small magnitude waves. This adaptive smoothing guarantees also solution stability without over smoothing phenomenon in stochastic media. Proper distinguishing between noise and small physical waves are challenging due to existence of spurious oscillations in numerical simulations. This identification is performed in this study by the MINMOD limiter based algorithm. Finally, efficiency of the proposed concept is verified by: 1) three benchmarks of one-dimensional (1-D) wave propagation problems; 2) P-SV point sources and rupturing line-source including a bounded fault zone with stochastic material properties.

The recently developed VMD technique is utilized to decompose the free decay response (FDR) of a structure into to modal responses. A novel procedure is developed to calculate the instantaneous modal frequencies and instantaneous modal damping ratios. The proposed identification method can straightforwardly extract the mode shape vectors using the modal responses extracted from the FDRs at all available sensors on the structure. A series of numerical and experimental case studies are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and highlight the superiority of the proposed method in modal parameter identification using both free vibration and ambient vibration data. The results of the present method are compared with those of the empirical mode decomposition-based method, and the superiorities of the present method are verified. The proposed method is proved to be efficient and accurate in modal parameter identification for both linear and nonlinear civil structures, including structures with closely spaced modes, sudden modal parameter variation, and amplitude-dependent modal parameters, etc.	[Zhang, Mingjie; Xu, Fuyou] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China	Xu, FY (reprint author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.	fuyouxu@hotmail.com			Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [DUT17ZD228]; National Program on Key Basic Research Project (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2015CB057705]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51478087]	The research is jointly supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. DUT17ZD228), National Program on Key Basic Research Project (973 Program, No. 2015CB057705), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51478087), which are gratefully acknowledged.	28	28	HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS	BEIJING	CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA	2095-2430	2095-2449		FRONT STRUCT CIV ENG	Front.

Meanwhile, it is convenient for factory production and it is beneficial to the cost savings, construction period shortening. Side joint is the weak region of PCS concrete frame and has great influence on seismic behavior of the whole structure. Thus systematically study on the seismic behavior of PCS concrete side joint is necessary. This paper presents a finite element study on behavior of the side joint under seismic loading. In the finite element model, PCS concrete and the reinforced concrete (RC) is modeled by the solid element and fiber-beam element, respectively. The numerical results is compared with the experimental results and it is found that the results of model based on fiber-beam element is in better agreement with the experimental results than solid element model. In addition, the overall seismic behavior of the side joints in PCS concrete is better than that of the RC with the same strength.

In conventional cylindrical pipelines, the axial and bending stresses brought about in their walls as a result of fault movement, lead to local buckling, which is construed as one of the major reasons contributing to pipeline failure. The present study has assessed 3-D numerical models of two kinds of buried textured pipelines, with 6 and 12 peripheral triangular facets, subjected to a strike-slip faulting normal to the axis of the pipelines, with and without internal pressure, with the two kinds of X65 and X80 steel, and with different diameter-to-thickness ratios. The results indicate that, because of specific geometry of this pipeline shell which is characterized by having lower axial stiffness and higher bending stiffness, compared to conventional cylindrical pipeline, they are considerably resistant to local buckling. The results of this study can be conceived of as a first step toward comprehensive seismic studies on this generation of pipelines which aim at replacing the conventional cylindrical pipelines with textured ones in areas subjected to fault movement.

The performance of concrete in a high-speed hard projectile impact is a complex problem due to a combination of multiple failure modes including brittle tensile fracture, crushing, and spalling. In this study, reinforced concrete (RC) and steel-concrete-steel sandwich (SCSS) panels are investigated under high-speed hard projectile impact. Two modeling techniques, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and conventional finite element (FE) analysis with element erosion are used. Penetration depth and global deformation are compared between doubly RC and SCSS panels in order to identify the advantages of the presence of steel plates over the reinforcement layers. A parametric analysis of the front and rear plate thicknesses of the SCSS configuration showed that the SCSS panel with a thick front plate has the best performance in controlling the hard projectile. While a thick rear plate is effective in the case of a large and soft projectile as the plate reduces the rear deformation. The effects of the impact angle and impact velocity are also considered. It was observed that the impact angle for the flat nose missile is critical and the front steel plate is effective in minimizing penetration depth.

Four push-out specimens were tested. It was found that no cracking, crushing or splitting was observed on the concrete slab, indicating that UHPC slab exhibited good performance and could resist the high force transferred from the headed studs. The numerical and experimental results indicated that the shear capacity is supposed to be composed of two parts stud shank shear contribution and concrete wedge block shear contribution. The stiffness increment of a stud in UHPC was at least 60% higher than that in normal strength concrete. Even if the stud height was reduced from 6d to 2d, there was no reduction in the shear strength of a stud. Short stud shear connectors with an aspect ratio as small as 2 could develop full strength in UHPC slabs. An empirical load-slip equation taking into account stud diameter was proposed to predict the load-slip response of a stud. The reliability and accuracy of the proposed load-slip equation was verified by the experimental and numerical load-slip curves.

A new Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm named Pareto Archived Genetic Algorithm (PAGA), which has an ability of integrating the nonlinear structural analysis with the provisions of American Petroleum Institute specification is employed to optimize the design of ellipse and sphere-shaped dome configurations. Thus, it is possible to investigate how the qualities of optimal designations vary considering the shape, size, and topology-related design variables. Furthermore, the computing efficiency of PAGA is evaluated considering six multi-objective optimization algorithms and eight quality measuring indicators. It is shown that PAGA has a capability of both exploring an increased number of pareto solutions and predicting a pareto front with a higher convergence degree. Moreover, the inclusion of shape-related design variables leads to a decrease in both the weights of dome structures and their load-carrying capacities. However, the designer easily determines the most requested optimal design through the archiving feature of PAGA. Thus, it is also demonstrated that the proposed optimal design procedure increases the correctness degree in the evaluation of optimal dome designs through the tradeoff analysis. Consequently, PAGA is recommended as an optimization tool for the design optimization of geometrically nonlinear dome structures.

One of these technologies used in the protection of structures is the semi-active control using a Magneto Rheological Damper device. But this device need an adequate controller with a robust algorithm of current or tension adjustment to operate which is further discussed in the following of this paper. In this study, a neural network controller is proposed to control the MR damper to eliminate vibrations of 3-story scaled structure exposed to Tohoku 2011 and Boumerdes 2003 earthquakes. The proposed controller is derived from a linear quadratic controller designed to control an MR damper installed in the first floor of the structure. Equipped with a feedback law the proposed control is coupled to a clipped optimal algorithm to adapt the current tension required to the MR damper adjustment. To evaluate the performance control of the proposed design controller, two numerical simulations of the controlled structure and uncontrolled structure are illustrated and compared.

The main parameter in this test is the water-cement (W/C) ratio. The novel analysis process and numerical program for DIC method were established. The displacements and strains of coarse aggregate, and cement mortar and interface transition zone (ITZ) were obtained and verified by experimental results. It was found that the axial displacement distributed non-uniformly during the loading stage, and the axial displacements of ITZs and cement mortar were larger than that of coarse aggregates before the occurrence of macrocracks. The effect of W/C on the horizontal displacement was not obvious. Test results also showed that the transverse and shear deformation concentration areas (DCAs) were formed when stress reached 30%-40% of the peak stress. The transverse and shear DCAs crossed the cement mortar, and ITZs and coarse aggregates. However, the axial DCA mainly surrounded the coarse aggregate. Generally, the higher W/C was, the more size and number of DCAs were. The crack propagations of specimens varied with the variation of W/C. The micro-crack of concrete mainly initiated in the ITZs, irrespective of the W/C. The number and distribution range of cracks in concrete with high W/C were larger than those of cracks in specimen adopting low W/C. However, the value and width of cracks in high W/C specimen were relatively small. The W/C had an obvious effect on the characteristics of concrete deterioration. Finally, the characteristics of crack was also evaluated by comparing the calculated results.

J	Wang, SC; Jiang, X; Bai, Y				Wang, Shaochun; Jiang, Xi; Bai, Yun			The influence of hand hole on the ultimate strength and crack pattern of shield tunnel segment joints by scaled model test	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						shield tunneling; structural synthetic fiber concrete; hand hole; segment joint; ultimate bearing capacity; crack pattern	MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; MESHFREE METHOD; FRACTURE; FIELD; SHELLS; PLATES	With the shield tunnel going deeper and deeper, the circumferential axial force becomes the governing factor rather than the bending moment. The hand hole acts as a weak point and initial damage in the segment joint especially when the circumferential axial force is extremely high. Despite the wide application of steel fiber or synthetic fiber in the tunneling, limited researches focus on the structural responses of segment joint with macro structural synthetic fiber (MSSF). In this paper, a 1:2 reduced-scale experiment was conducted to study the structural performance of the segment joint with different types of hand holes under ultra-high axial force. Special attention is paid to failure mode and structural performance (bearing capacity, deformation, cracking, and toughness). Moreover, segment joints with MSSF are also tested to evaluate the effects of MSSF on the failure mode and structural performance of the segment joints. The experiment results show that the hand hole becomes the weakest point of the segment joint under ultra-high axial force. A \ /-type crack pattern is always observed before the final failure of the segment joints. Different types and sizes of the hand hole have different degree of influences on the structural behavior of segment joints. The segment joint with MSSF shows higher ultimate bearing capacity and toughness compared to segment joint with common concrete. Besides, the MSSF improves the initial cracking load and anti-spallling resistance of the segment joint.

After validating the accuracy of the finite element modeling approach against previous experiments, 112 computational models with different geometrical properties were constructed and analyzed including consideration of initial imperfections. The resulting yielding moment, corresponding critical shear force, the accumulation of plastic strains through the length of links as well as the amount of energy dissipated are investigated. The results indicate that as the shape of the butterfly-shaped links become too straight or conversely too narrow in the middle, peak accumulated plastic strains increase. The significant effect of plate thickness on the buckling limit state is examined in this study. Results show that overstrength for these links (peak force divided by yield force) is between 1.2 and 4.5, with straight links producing larger overstrength. Additionally, proportioning the links to delay buckling, and designing the links to yield in the flexural mode are shown to improve energy dissipation.

J	Yu, YJ; Chen, ZH; Yan, RZ				Yu, Yujie; Chen, Zhihua; Yan, Renzhang			Finite element modeling of cable sliding and its effect on dynamic response of cable-supported truss	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						sliding cable; explicit solution framework; original length method; seismic response; cable rupture	SUSPEN-DOME; FORMULATION; SIMULATION	The cable system of cable-supported structures usually bears high tension forces, and clip joints may fail to resist cable sliding in cases of earthquake excitations or sudden cable breaks. A analytical method that considers the dynamic cable sliding effect is proposed in this paper. Cable sliding behaviors and the resultant dynamic responses are solved by combining the vector form intrinsic finite element framework with cable force redistribution calculations that consider joint frictions. The cable sliding effect and the frictional tension loss are solved with the original length method that uses cable length and the original length relations. Then, the balanced tension distributions are calculated after frictional sliding. The proposed analytical method is achieved within MATLAB and applied to simulate the dynamic response of a cable-supported plane truss under seismic excitation and sudden cable break. During seismic excitations, the cable sliding behavior in the cable-supported truss have an averaging effect on the oscillation magnitudes, but it also magnifies the internal force response in the upper truss structure. The slidable cable joints can greatly reduce the ability of a cable system to resist sudden cable breaks, while strong friction resistances at the cable-strut joints can help retain internal forces.

This paper describes the numerical modeling of CLSM fills with finite element method under compression loading and the bond performance of CLSM and steel rebar under pullout loading. The study was conducted using a plastic-damage model which captures the material behavior using both classical theory of elasto-plasticity and continuum damage mechanics. The capability of the finite element approach for the analysis of CLSM fills was assessed by a comparison with the experimental results from a laboratory compression test on CLSM cylinders and pullout tests. The analysis shows that the behavior of a CLSM fill while subject to a failure compression load or pullout tension load can be simulated in a reasonably accurate manner.

Hence, developing precise tools for predicting drift capacities of reinforced concrete (RC) columns is of great interest. RC columns are not only frequently constructed, but also their composite behavior makes the capacity prediction a task faced with many uncertainties. In the current article, novel empirical approaches are presented for predicting flexural, shear and axial failure modes in RC columns. To this aim, an extensive experimental database was created by collecting outcomes of previously conducted experimental tests since 1964, which are available in the literature. It serves as the basis for deriving the equations for predicting the drift capacity of RC columns by different regression analyses (both linear with different orders and nonlinear). Furthermore, fragility curves are determined for comparing the obtained results with the experimental results and with previously proposed models, like the ones of ASCE/SEI 41-13. It is demonstrated that the proposed equations predict drift capacities, which are in better agreement with experimental results than those computed by previously published models. In addition, the reliability of the proposed equations is higher from a probabilistic point of view.

However, broad application of ECC is hindered by its high cost. This paper presents a new means to address this issue by introducing a composite beam with a U-shaped ECC permanent formwork and infill concrete. The flexural performance of the ECC/RC composite beam has been investigated experimentally with eight specimens. According to the test results, the failure of a composite beam with a U-shaped ECC formwork is initiated by the crushing of compressive concrete rather than debonding, even if the surface between the ECC and the concrete is smooth as-finished. Under the same reinforcement configurations, ECC/RC composite beams exhibit increases in flexural performance in terms of ductility, load-carrying capacity, and damage tolerance compared with the counterpart ordinary RC beam. Furthermore, a theoretical model based on the strip method is proposed to predict the moment-curvature responses of ECC/RC composite beams, and a simplified method based on the equivalent rectangular stress distribution approach has also evolved. The theoretical results are found to be in good agreement with the test data.

To introduce particle damping technology to long-period structure seismic control, a novel multilayer compartmental particle damper (MCPD) was proposed, and a 1/20 scale test model of a typical long-period self-anchored suspension bridge with a single tower was designed and fabricated. The model was subjected to a series of shaking table tests with and without the MCPD. The results showed that the seismic responses of the flexible or semi-flexible bridge towers of long-period bridges influence the seismic responses of the main beam. The MCPD can be conveniently installed on the main beam and bridge tower and can effectively reduce the longitudinal peak displacement and the root mean square acceleration of the main beam and tower. In addition, no particle accumulation was observed during the tests. A well-designed MCPD can achieve significant damping for long-period structures under seismic excitations of different intensities. These results indicate that the application of MCPDs for seismic control of single-tower self-anchored suspension bridges and other long-period structures is viable.

Marble epistyles under shear: An experimental study of the role of "Relieving Space"	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Review						monuments of cultural heritage; marble epistyles; pressure stimulated currents; acoustic emission; digital image correlation	PRESSURE STIMULATED CURRENTS; ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; BRAZILIAN DISC; CLASSIFICATION; MONUMENTS; CONCRETE; NONLINEARITY; BEAMS	The mechanical response of mutually interconnected epistyles is studied experimentally. The specimens are made of two marble blocks connected to each other with an I-shaped titanium connector placed in grooves sculptured on the blocks and covered with cementitious material. The specific way of connecting epistyles simulates the one used by scientists restoring the ancient connections of the epistyles of the Parthenon Temple. This connection, although designed to sustain mainly tensile loading, undertakes, also, shear load, in case of excitations imposing to the epistyles displacements normal to the connector's axis. Attention is focused to enlighten the role of a novel design technique aiming to relieve the stress field around the connector. According to this technique, part of the connector's web is left uncovered, forming the so-called Relieving Space, assisting the unconstrained deformation of the connector. Both traditional and innovative sensing techniques were employed in an effort to obtain data from the interior of the three-material-complex (marble-cementitious material-titanium). Analysis of the data indicated that the Relieving Space reduces the overall stiffness of the system, protecting marble in case of over-loading. Moreover, it was concluded that the innovative techniques employed provide pre-failure indicators well in advance of the catastrophic failure of the specimens.	[Pasiou, E. D.; Kourkoulis, S.

For design and quality control of the final product in FDR method, the unconfined compressive strength of stabilized material should be known. This paper aims to develop a mathematical model for predicting the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of soil-RAP blend stabilized with Portland cement based on multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS). To this end, two different aggregate materials were mixed with different percentages of RAP and then stabilized by different percentages of Portland cement. For training and testing of MARS model, total of 64 experimental UCS data were employed. Predictors or independent variables in the developed model are percentage of RAP, percentage of cement, optimum moisture content, percent passing of #200 sieve, and curing time. The results demonstrate that MARS has a great ability for prediction of the UCS in case of soil-RAP blend stabilized with Portland cement (R-2 is more than 0.97). Sensitivity analysis of the proposed model showed that the cement, optimum moisture content, and percent passing of #200 sieve are the most influential parameters on the UCS of FDR layer.

J	Ghasemi, MR; Camp, CV; Dizangian, B				Ghasemi, Mohammad Reza; Camp, Charles V.; Dizangian, Babak			Novel decoupled framework for reliability-based design optimization of structures using a robust shifting technique	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						reliability-based design optimization; trusses; sensitivity analysis; shifting technique; cubic B-splines; response surface method	RESPONSE-SURFACE METHOD; SEQUENTIAL OPTIMIZATION; TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION; SPACE	In a reliability-based design optimization (RBDO), computation of the failure probability (P-f) at all design points through the process may suitably be avoided at the early stages. Thus, to reduce extensive computations of RBDO, one could decouple the optimization and reliability analysis. The present work proposes a new methodology for such a decoupled approach that separates optimization and reliability analysis into two procedures which significantly improve the computational efficiency of the RBDO. This technique is based on the probabilistic sensitivity approach (PSA) on the shifted probability density function. Stochastic variables are separated into two groups of desired and non-desired variables. The three-phase procedure may be summarized as: Phase 1, apply deterministic design optimization based on mean values of random variables; Phase 2, move designs toward a reliable space using PSA and finding a primary reliable optimum point; Phase 3, applying an intelligent self-adaptive procedure based on cubic B-spline interpolation functions until the targeted failure probability is reached. An improved response surface method is used for computation of failure probability. The proposed RBDO approach could significantly reduce the number of analyses required to less than 10% of conventional methods. The computational efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by solving four benchmark truss design problems published in the structural optimization literature.

Nowadays, with progress in cement industry provides, it has become possible to produce cement type I with strength classes of 32.5, 42.5, and 52.5 MPa. On the one hand, the microstructure of cement has changed, and modified by NS, MS, and polymers; therefore it is very important to determine the optimal percentage of each additives for those CSCs. In this study, 12 mix designs containing different percentages of MS, NS, and polymer fibers in three cement strength classes(CSCs) (32.5, 42.5, and 52.5 MPa) were designed and constructed based on the mixture method. Results indicated the sensitivity of each CSCs can be different on the NS or MS in compressive strength of concrete. Consequently, strength classes have a significant effect on the amount of MS and NS in mix design of concrete. While, polymer fibers don't have significant effect in compressive strength considering CSCs.

These two parameters are very important as for the ductility, strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation capacity for a given reinforced concrete column. Effects of variable axial load ratio and transverse reinforcement ratio on the seismic performance of reinforced concrete columns are thoroughly analyzed. The finite element computer program Seismo-Structure was used to perform the analysis of series of reinforced concrete columns tested by the second author and other researchers. In order to reflect the reality and grasp the actual behavior of the specimens, special attention was paid to select the models for concrete, confined concrete, and steel components. Good agreements were obtained between the experimental and the analytical results either for the lateral force-drift relationships or for the damage progress prediction at different stages of the loading.

J	Tan, F; Lahmer, T				Tan, Fengjie; Lahmer, Tom			Shape design of arch dams under load uncertainties with robust optimization	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						arch dam; shape optimization; robust optimization; load uncertainty; approximation model	METHODOLOGY	Due to an increased need in hydro-electricity, water storage, and flood protection, it is assumed that a series of new dams will be build throughout the world. The focus of this paper is on the non-probabilistic-based design of new arch-type dams by applying means of robust design optimization (RDO). This type of optimization takes into account uncertainties in the loads and in the material properties of the structure. As classical procedures of probabilistic-based optimization under uncertainties, such as RDO and reliability-based design optimization (RBDO), are in general computationally expensive and rely on estimates of the system's response variance, we will not follow a full-probabilistic approach but work with predefined confidence levels. This leads to a bi-level optimization program where the volume of the dam is optimized under the worst combination of the uncertain parameters. As a result, robust and reliable designs are obtained and the result is independent from any assumptions on stochastic properties of the random variables in the model. The optimization of an arch-type dam is realized here by a robust optimization method under load uncertainty, where hydraulic and thermal loads are considered. The load uncertainty is modeled as an ellipsoidal expression. Comparing with any traditional deterministic optimization method, which only concerns the minimum objective value and offers a solution candidate close to limit-states, the RDO method provides a robust solution against uncertainty. To reduce the computational cost, a ranking strategy and an approximation model are further involved to do a preliminary screening. By this means, the robust design can generate an improved arch dam structure that ensures both safety and serviceability during its lifetime.

For this purpose, the enhanced genetic algorithm methodology named EGAwMP is utilized as an optimization tool. The evolutionary search mechanism of EGAwMP is constituted on the basis of generational genetic algorithm (GGA). The exploration capacity of EGAwMP is improved in a way of dividing an entire population into sub-populations and using of a radial basis neural network for dynamically adjustment of EGAwMP's genetic operator parameters. In order to improve the exploitation capability of EGAwMP, the proposed neural network implementation is also utilized for prediction of more accurate design variables associating with a new design strategy, design codes of which are based on the provisions of LRFD_AISC V3 specification. EGAwMP is applied to determine the real-life ready steel profiles for the optimal design of skeletal structures with 105, 200, 444, and 942 members. EGAwMP accomplishes to increase the quality degrees of optimum designations Furthermore, the importance of using the real-life steel profiles and design codes is also demonstrated. Consequently, EGAwMP is suggested as a design optimization tool for the real-life steel skeletal structures.

Furthermore, a new approach for taking into account the uncertainties associated with the steel shear buildings is proposed. In the proposed approach, the probabilistic distributions of the stiffness and yield properties of stories of a set of reference steel moment frame structures are derived through Monte-Carlo sampling. The approach is applied to steel shear buildings isolated with LRB systems. The base isolation systems are designed for different target base displacements by minimizing a relative performance index using Genetic Algorithm. Thereafter, the base-isolated structures are equipped with TLDs and a combination of the base and TLD properties is sought by which the maximum reduction occurs in the base displacement without compromising the performance of the system. In addition, the effects of TLD properties on the performance of the system are studied through a parametric study. Based on the analyses results, the base displacement can be reduced 23% by average, however, the maximum reduction can go beyond 30%.

An investigation is performed here on a 10 story steel moment resisting structure designed to meet the life safety level of performance when different beam removal scenarios after earthquake are considered. To this end, the structure is first subjected to the design earthquake simulated by Tabas earthquake acceleration. The beam removal scenarios are then considered at different locations assuming that both ends connections of the beam to columns are simultaneously detached from the columns; thus the removed beam falls on the underneath floor with an impact. This imposes considerable loads to the structure leading to a progressive collapse in all the scenarios considered. The results also show that the upper stories are much more vulnerable under such scenarios than the lower stories. Hence, more attention shall be paid to the beam-to-column connections of the upper stories during the process of design and construction.

To investigate the CB effect on the dynamic moduli of CB MA mixtures, one commonly used asphalt mixture (AC-20) was designed with BA, SBS MA, and CB MA, respectively. Then, the uniaxial compression dynamic modulus tests were conducted at different temperatures and loading frequencies, the master curves of asphalt mixtures were analyzed based on the time-temperature equivalence principle. The results show that with increasing loading frequency, the temperature dependence of dynamic moduli of all asphalt mixtures tend to be less obvious. Both SBS and CB can decrease the temperature sensitivity of asphalt mixture, the SBS MA mixture has the lowest temperature sensitivity, followed by CB MA and BA mixture. In addition, CB and SBS can obviously improve the dynamic modulus of the BA mixture, enhance the anti-deformation performance of pavement structure, and the improvement effect of CB is almost the same with SBS.

The model is meant to serve as a simple but reliable tool for estimating the moment capacity of ferrocement members. The proposed model is trained and validated using experimental data obtained from the literature. The data consists of information regarding flexural tests on ferrocement specimens which include moment capacity and cross-sectional dimensions of specimens, concrete cube compressive strength, tensile strength and volume fraction of wire mesh. Comparisons of predictions of the proposed models with experimental data indicated that the models are capable of accurately estimating the moment capacity of ferrocement members. The proposed models also make better predictions compared to methods such as the plastic analysis method and the mechanism approach. Further comparisons with other data mining techniques including the back-propagation network, the adaptive spline, and the Kriging regression models indicated that the proposed models are superior in terms prediction accuracy despite being much simpler models. The performance of the proposed models was also found to be comparable to the GEP-based surrogate model.

The elastic buckling properties of the section were calculated using readily available linear elastic buckling analysis tools based on Generalized Beam Theory (GBT) and Finite Strip Method (FSM). Obtained FE results were compared with those obtained experimentally, and once verified the developed FE modeling technique was used to carry out a parametric study to examine changes in structural response due to variations in length, depth and spacing of C-stitches. Observed influences of C-stitches on the behavior and resistance of the considered columns were carefully analyzed, and key design aspects are presented herein.

Such cracks result from limited tension strength of the soil. A tension cut-off in Mohr-Coulomb shear strength can represent this limited strength. Presented is an extension of variational analysis of slope stability with a tension crack considering seismicity. Both translational and rotational failure mechanisms are included in a pseudo-static analysis of slope stability. Developed is a closed-form to assess the seismic stability of slopes with zero tensile strength. The results indicate that the presence of the tension crack has significant effects on the seismic stability of slopes, i.e., leading to small value of the yield acceleration. Considering soil tension strength in seismic slope analysis may lead to overestimation on the stability, as much as 50% for vertical slopes. Imposing tension crack results in transit of the critical failure mode to a straight line from a log-spiral, except for flat slopes with small soil cohesion. Under seismic conditions, large cohesion may increase the depth of crack, moving it closer to the slope.

The physical parameters which required to be updated are uncertain parameters including geometry, material properties and boundary conditions of the aforementioned structure. To determine these uncertain parameters, local and global sensitivity analyses are performed to increase the solution accuracy. An objective function is determined using the sum of the squared errors between the natural frequencies calculated by finite element method and operational modal analysis, which is optimized using bees optimization algorithm. The natural frequencies of the solar power plant structure are estimated by multi-setup stochastic subspace identification method which is considered as a strong and efficient method in operational modal analysis. The proposed algorithm is efficiently implemented on the solar power plant structure located in Shahid Chamran university of Ahvaz, Iran, to update parameters of its finite element model. Moreover, computed natural frequencies by numerical method are compared with those of the operational modal analysis. The results indicate that, bees optimization algorithm leads accurate results with fast convergence.

J	Shao, XD; Deng, L; Cao, JH				Shao, Xudong; Deng, Lu; Cao, Junhui			Innovative steel-UHPC composite bridge girders for long-span bridges	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						steel-UHPC composite bridge girder; long-span bridge; orthotropic steel deck; fatigue cracking; durability	PERFORMANCE	Steel and steel-concrete composite girders are two types of girders commonly used for long-span bridges. However, practice has shown that the two types of girders have some drawbacks. For steel girders, the orthotropic steel deck (OSD) is vulnerable to fatigue cracking and the asphalt overlay is susceptible to damage such as rutting and pot holes. While for steel-concrete composite girders, the concrete deck is generally thick and heavy, and the deck is prone to cracking because of its low tensile strength and high creep. Thus, to improve the serviceability and durability of girders for long-span bridges, three new types of steel-UHPC lightweight composite bridge girders are proposed, where UHPC denotes ultra-high performance concrete. The first two types consist of an OSD and a thin UHPC layer while the third type consists of a steel beam and a UHPC waffle deck. Due to excellent mechanical behaviors and impressive durability of UHPC, the steel-UHPC composite girders have the advantages of light weight, high strength, low creep coefficient, low risk of cracking, and excellent durability, making them competitive alternatives for long-span bridges. To date, the proposed steel-UHPC composite girders have been applied to 14 real bridges in China. It is expected that the application of the new steel-UHPC composite girders on long-span bridges will have a promising future.

The OSD can act as framework for concrete plate and contribute to load bearing capacity at the same time, which could save construction time. Compared with conventional OSD system, this new type of composite bridge deck can also improve fatigue performance.Considering that this type of composite deck is not yet applied in practical engineering and its mechanical performance is not revealed in previous literatures, two full-scale specimens were designed and manufactured in this research. The mechanical performance, particularly, bending capacity in positive and negative region was carefully tested and analyzed. The load-deflection curve, load-slip relation, strain distribution in concrete and steel were obtained. The test results showed that the plastic performance of this kind of composite bridge deck was satisfying and the bending capacity was high.

Mechanical properties of steel, glass, and hybrid fiber reinforced reactive powder concrete	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						reactive powder concrete; steel fiber; glass fiber; hybrid fiber	BEHAVIOR; STRENGTH; COLUMNS	This study examines the properties of fiber-reinforced reactive powder concrete (FR-RPC). Steel fibers, glass fibers, and steel-glass hybrid fibers were used to prepare the FR-RPC. The non-fibrous reactive powder concrete (NF-RPC) was prepared as a reference mix. The proportion of fibers by volume for all FR-RPC mixes was 1.5%. Steel fibers of 13 mm length and 0.2 mm diameter were used to prepare the steel fiber-reinforced RPC (SFR-RPC). Glass fibers of 13 mm length and 1.3 mm diameter were used to prepare the glass fiber-reinforced RPC (GFR-RPC). The hybrid fiber-reinforced RPC (HFR-RPC) was prepared by mixing 0.9% steel fibers and 0.6% glass fibers. Compressive strength, axial load-axial deformation behavior, modulus of elasticity, indirect tensile strength, and shear strength of the RPC mixes were investigated. The results showed that SFR-RPC achieved higher compressive strength, indirect tensile strength and shear strength than NF-RPC, GFR-RPC, and HFR-RPC. Although the compressive strengths of GFR-RPC and HFR-RPC were slightly lower than the compressive strength of NF-RPC, the shear strengths of GFR-RPC and HFR-RPC were higher than that of NF-RPC.

Compared to normal concrete, bacterial concrete possesses higher durability and engineering concrete properties. The production of calcium carbonate in bacterial concrete is limited to the calcium content in cement. Hence calcium lactate is externally added to be an additional source of calcium in the concrete. The influence of this addition on compressive strength, self-healing capability of cracks is highlighted in this study. The bacterium used in the study is bacillus subtilis and was added to both spore powder form and culture form to the concrete. Bacillus subtilis spore powder of 2 million cfu/g concentration with 0.5% cement was mixed to concrete. Calcium lactates with concentrations of 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, and 2.5% of cement, was added to the concrete mixes to test the effect on properties of concrete. In other samples, cultured bacillus subtilis with a concentration of 1x10(5) cells/mL was mixed with concrete, to study the effect of bacteria in the cultured form on the properties of concrete. Cubes of 100 mmx100 mmx100 mm were used for the study. These cubes were tested after a curing period of 7, 14 and 28 d. A maximum of 12% increase in compressive strength was observed with the addition of 0.5% of calcium lactate in concrete. Scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy examination showed the formation of ettringite in pores; calcium silicate hydrates and calcite which made the concrete denser. A statistical technique was applied to analyze the experimental data of the compressive strengths of cementations materials. Response surface methodology was adopted for optimizing the experimental data. The regression equation was yielded by the application of response surface methodology relating response variables to input parameters. This method aids in predicting the experimental results accurately with an acceptable range of error. Findings of this investigation indicated the influence of added calcium lactate in bio-concrete which is quite impressive for improving the compressive strength and self-healing properties of concrete.

Dez arch dam is chosen as the case study; it is modeled along with its rock foundation using the finite element method considering the stage construction. Since previous studies concentrated on simplified models and approaches, comprehensive study of the arch dam model along with efficient and state-of-the-art uncertainty methods are incorporated in this investigation. The reliability method is performed to assess the safety level and the sensitivity analyses for identifying critical input factors and their interaction effects on the response of the dam. Global sensitivity analysis based on improved Latin hypercube sampling is employed in this study to indicate the influence of each random variable and their interaction on variance of the responses. Four levels of model advancement are considered for the dam-foundation system: 1) Monolithic dam without any joint founded on the homogeneous rock foundation, 2) monolithic dam founded on the inhomogeneous foundation including soft rock layers, 3) jointed dam including the peripheral and contraction joints founded on the homogeneous foundation, and 4) jointed dam founded on the inhomogeneous foundation. For each model, proper performance indices are defined through limit-state functions. In this manner, the effects of input parameters in each performance level of the dam are investigated. The outcome of this study is defining the importance of input factors in each stage and model based on the variance of the dam response. Moreover, the results of sampling are computed in order to assess the safety level of the dam in miscellaneous loading and modeling conditions.	[Khaneghahi, M.

In this work, mode-shape dependent shifting phenomenon of peaks of impedance curve with change in void location has been analyzed. A number of initial guesses followed by an iterative optimization algorithm based on univariate method has been used to solve the problem. In each iteration starting from each initial guess, the difference between the computationally obtained impedance curve and the target impedance curve has been reduced. This methodology has been extended to detect single circular metallic inclusion in 2D piezoelectric cantilever beam. A good accuracy level was observed for detection of flaw radius and flaw-location along beam-length, but not the precise location along beam-width.	[Samanta, S.; Nanthakumar, S.

These structures have been recently highly regarded for beauty, lightweight, determine behavior, proper performance against lateral loads and the ability of been compactly packaged. At this time, there is a few studies done considering practical optimization of these structures. Loading considered here includes wind and gravity loads. In foldable scissor-like structures, connections have a complex behavior. For this reason, in this study, the authors used the ABAQUS commercial package as an analyzer in the optimization procedure. This made the obtained optimal solutions highly reliable from the point of view of applicability and construction requirements. Also, to do optimization task, a fast genetic algorithm method, which has been recently introduced by authors, was utilized. Optimization results show that despite less weight for aluminum models than steel models, aluminum deployable structures are not affordable because they need more material than steel structures and cause more environmental damage.

The kernel of such bridge management is to develop a method of safety(condition) assessment on items which include remaining life and load carrying capacity. Bridge health monitoring using information technology and sensors is capable of providing more accurate knowledge of bridge performance than traditional strategies. The aim of this paper is to introduce a state-of-the-art on not only a rational bridge health monitoring system incorporating with the information and communication technologies for lifetime management of existing short and medium span bridges but also a continuous data collecting system designed for bridge health monitoring of mainly short and medium span bridges. In this paper, although there are some useful monitoring methods for short and medium span bridges based on the qualitative or quantitative information, mainly two advanced structural health monitoring systems are described to review and analyse the potential of utilizing the long term health monitoring in safety assessment and management issues for short and medium span bridge. The first is a special designed mobile in-situ loading device(vehicle) for short and medium span road bridges to assess the structural safety(performance) and derive optimal strategies for maintenance using reliability based method. The second is a long term health monitoring method by using the public buses as part of a public transit system (called bus monitoring system) to be applied mainly to short and medium span bridges, along with safety indices, namely, characteristic deflection which is relatively free from the influence of dynamic disturbances due to such factors as the roughness of the road surface, and a structural anomaly parameter.

J	Zhang, ZT				Zhang, Zhitian			Mean wind load induced incompatibility in nonlinear aeroelastic simulations of bridge spans	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						bridge; aerodynamics; nonlinear; aeroelastic model; Pseudo-steady; mean wind loads	INDICIAL FUNCTIONS; AEROSTATIC DIVERGENCE; SUSPENSION BRIDGES; FLUTTER; STABILITY; IDENTIFICATION; COEFFICIENTS; FORCES; MODELS	Mean wind response induced incompatibility and nonlinearity in bridge aerodynamics is discussed, where the mean wind and aeroelastic loads are applied simultaneously in time domain. A kind of incompatibility is found during the simultaneous simulation of the mean wind and aeroelastic loads, which leads to incorrect mean wind structural responses. It is found that the mathematic expectations (or limiting characteristics) of the aeroelastic models are fundamental to this kind of incompatibility. In this paper, two aeroelastic models are presented and discussed, one of indicial-function-denoted (IF-denoted) and another of rational-function-denoted (RF-denoted). It is shown that, in cases of low wind speeds, the IF-denoted model reflects correctly the mean wind load properties, and results in correct mean structural responses; in contrast, the RF-denoted model leads to incorrect mean responses due to its nonphysical mean properties. At very high wind speeds, however, even the IF-denoted model can lead to significant deviation from the correct response due to steady aerodynamic nonlinearity. To solve the incompatibility at high wind speeds, a methodology of subtraction of pseudo-steady effects from the aeroelastic model is put forward in this work. Finally, with the method presented, aeroelastic nonlinearity resulted from the mean wind response is investigated at both moderate and high wind speeds.

In the present paper, experimental results from tests on eight prestressed RPC I-section girders failing in shear are reported herein. The beams with RPC of 120 MPa in compression were designed to assess the ability to carry shear stress in thin webbed prestressed beams with stirrups. The test variables were the level of prestressing, shear span-depth ratio (a/d) and stirrup ratio. Shear deformation, shear capacity and crack pattern were experimentally investigated in detail. With regard to the shear resistance of the test beams, the predictions from three standards (AFGC, JSCE and SIA) on the design of UHPC structures were compared with the experimental result suggesting that the experimental strength is almost always higher than predicted. RPC, as a new concrete, was different from normal concrete and fiber reinforced concrete. Further study should be needed to develop an analytical method and computation model for shear strength of RPC beams.

A total of 16 RACFST columns were tested in this study. The main parameters varied in this study are recycled coarse aggregate replacement percentages (0%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 100%), expansive agent dosages (0%, 8%, and 15%) and an eccentric distance of compressive load from the center of the column (0 and 40 mm). Experimental results showed that the ultimate stresses of RACFST columns decreased with increasing recycled coarse aggregate replacement percentages but appropriate expansive agent dosages can reduce the decrement; the incorporation of expansive agent decreased the ultimate stresses of RACFST columns but an appropriate dosage can increase the deformation ability. The recycled coarse aggregate replacement percentages have limited influence on the ultimate stresses of the RACFST columns and has more effect than that of the normal aggregate concrete-filled steel tubular columns.

Meanwhile, reclamation of landfill sites to create a new land space after their closure becomes an important goal in the current fewer and fewer land availability scenario in many narrow countries. The objective of this study is to reclaim incineration residue materials in the landfill site by using cement and coal fly ash as stabilizers aiming at performing quality check as new developed materials before future construction. Indeed, physical and mechanical properties of these new materials should be initially examined at the micro scale, which is the primary fundamental for construction at larger scale. This research examines quantitative influences of using the combination of cement and coal fly ash at different ratio on the internal structure and ability of strength enhancement of incineration residues when suffering from loading. Couple of industrial and micro-focus X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanners combined with an image analysis technique were utilized to characterize and visualize the behavior and internal structure of the incineration residues-cement-coal fly ash mixture under the series of unconfined compression test and curing period effect. Nine types of cement solidified incineration residues in term of different curing period (i.e., 7, 14, 28 days) and coal fly ash addition content (i.e., 0%, 9%, 18%) were scanned before and after unconfined compression tests. It was shown that incineration residues solidified by cement and coal fly ash showed an increase in compression strength and deformation modulus with curing time and coal fly ash content. Three-dimension computed tomography images observation and analysis confirmed that solidified incineration residues including incineration bottom and fly ash as well as cement and coal fly ash have the deliquescent materials. Then, it was studied that stabilized parts play a more important role than spatial void distribution in increment or reduction of compression strength.

However, to investigate wind pressure at the edge of the building, the work presented in this paper focuses on the extrapolation reconstruction of wind pressure fields. Here, we propose an improved proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and Kriging method with a von Karman correlation function to resolve this issue. The studies show that it works well for not only interpolation reconstruction but also extrapolation reconstruction. The proposed method does require determination of the Hurst exponent and other parameters analysed from the original data. Hence, the fluctuating wind fields have been characterized by the von Karman correlation function, as an a priori function. Compared with the cubic spline method and different variogram, preliminary results suggest less time consumption and high efficiency in extrapolation reconstruction at the edge.

This paper aims to determine the shear strength of steel fiber reinforced concrete beams using the application of data-intelligence models namely hybrid artificial neural network integrated with particle swarm optimization. For the considered data-intelligence models, the input matrix attribute is one of the central element in attaining accurate predictive model. Hence, various input attributes are constructed to model the shear strength as a targeted variable. The modeling is initiated using historical published researches steel fiber reinforced concrete beams information. Seven variables are used as input attribute combination including reinforcement ratio (%), concrete compressive strength (f(c)), fiber factor (F-1), volume percentage of fiber (V-f), fiber length to diameter ratio (l(f) =l(d)) effective depth (d), and shear span-to-strength ratio (a/d), while the shear strength (S-s) is the output of the matrix. The best network structure obtained using the network having ten nodes and one hidden layer. The final results obtained indicated that the hybrid predictive model of ANN-PSO can be used efficiently in the prediction of the shear strength of fiber reinforced concrete beams. In more representable details, the hybrid model attained the values of root mean square error and correlation coefficient 0.567 and 0.82, respectively.

Pile length (L), angle of oblique load (), sand density (), number of batter piles (B), and number of vertical piles (V) as input and oblique load (Q) as output was used. Results suggest improved performance by RF regression for both pile groups. M5 model tree provides simple linear relation which can be used for the prediction of oblique load for field data also. Model developed using RF regression approach with smooth pile group data was found to be in good agreement for rough piles data. NN based approach was found performing equally well with both smooth and rough piles. Sensitivity analysis using all three modelling approaches suggest angle of oblique load () and number of batter pile (B) affect the oblique load capacity for both smooth and rough pile groups.

A total of twenty three-dimensional nonlinear finite element models were developed taking into account various constitutive laws for concrete material in compression (crushing) and tension (cracking), steel plasticity (i.e., yielding and strain hardening), bond-slip at the concrete and steel reinforcement interface as well as unique behavior of spring-like support elements. These models are first validated by comparing numerical predictions in terms of load-deflection response, crack propagation, reaction distribution, and failure mode against that of measured experimental data reported in literature. Once the developed models were successfully validated, a parametric study was designed and performed. This parametric study examined number of critical parameters such as ratio and spacing of the longitudinal and vertical reinforcement, compressive and tensile strength of concrete, as well as degree (stiffness) and location of support stiffness to induce varying levels of differential settlement. This study also aims at presenting a numerical approach using finite element simulation, supplemented with coherent assumptions, such that engineers, practitioners, and researchers can carry out simple, but yet effective and realistic analysis of RC structural members undergoing differential settlements due to variety of load actions.

We define four qualitative criteria for this assessment, i.e., construction-ability, cost effectiveness, participation of the structure in fulfillment of the visual, and functional-semantic needs of the architectural form. For this purpose, two case studies including the Jame Mosque of Isfahan and the Soltaniyeh building are investigated.

Punching shear behavior of recycled aggregate concrete slabs with and without steel fibres	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						recycled aggregate concrete; steel fibres; slab; punching shear; recycled coarse aggregates replacement percentage	COLUMN CONNECTIONS; STRENGTH; PREDICTION; RESISTANCE; FAILURE	A study on the punching shear behavior of 8 slabs with recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) was carried out. The two main factors considered were the recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) replacement percentage and the steel fibre volumetric ratio. The failure pattern, load-displacement curves, energy consumption, and the punching shear capacity of the slabs were intensively investigated. It was concluded that the punching shear capacity, ductility and energy consumption decreased with the increase of RCA replacement percentage. Research findings indicated that the incorporation of steel fibres could not only improve the energy dissipation capacity and the punching shear capacity of the slab, but also effectively improve the integrity of the slab tension surface and thereby changing the trend from typical punching failure pattern to bending-punching failure pattern. On the basis of the test, the punching shear capacity formula of RAC slabs with and without steel fibres was proposed and discussed.

Hydration at early age was evaluated using semi-adiabatic calorimetry and at late ages using non-evaporable water content and thermogravimetric analysis. The transport characteristic was assessed by measuring electrical resistivity. The binary paste with slag showed the highest hydration activity compared to the binary pastes with GP and fly ash (FA). The results indicated that the pozzolanic behavior of the binary paste with GP was less than that of the binary pastes with slag or FA at late ages. An increase in the electrical resistivity and compressive strength of the binary paste with GP compared to other modified pastes at late ages was observed. It was shown that GP tends to increase the drying shrinkage of the pastes. Ternary pastes containing GP did not exhibit synergistic enhancements compared to the respective binary pastes.

It enables us to replace high-cost shell models with stiffness-equivalent orthotropic plate alternatives. Many homogenization models for corrugated panels of different shapes have been proposed. However, there is a lack of investigations for verifying their accuracy and reliability. In addition, in the recent trend of development of smoothed finite element methods, the cell-based smoothed three-node Mindlin plate element (CS-MIN3) based on the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) has been proposed and successfully applied to many analyses of plate and shell structures. Thus, this paper further extends the CS-MIN3 by integrating itself with homogenization models to give homogenization methods. In these methods, the equivalent extensional, bending, and transverse shear stiffness components which constitute the equivalent orthotropic plate models are represented in explicit analytical expressions. Using the results of ANSYS and ABAQUS shell simulations as references, some numerical examples are conducted to verify the accuracy and reliability of the homogenization methods for static analyses of trapezoidally and sinusoidally corrugated panels.

We will not only provide an extensive review of those methods which can be found elsewhere but particularly address their potential in modelling fracture in rock mechanics and geotechnical engineering. In this context, we will discuss their key applications, assumptions, and limitations. Furthermore, we also address general' difficulties that may arise for simulating fracture in rock and fractured rock. This review will conclude with some final remarks and future challenges.

Generally, shearing fracture model occurs in both the tests. Compressive strength is higher than tensile strength for a material. Shearing fracture angle is smaller than 45 degrees under uniaxial compression and greater than 45 degrees under uniaxial tension. In this work, a unified relation of material strength under uniaxial compression and tension is developed by correlating the shearing fracture angle in theory. This constitutive relation is quantitatively illustrated by a function for analyzing the material strength from shear fracture angle. A computational simulation is conducted to validate this theoretical function. It is full of interest to give a scientific illustration for designing the high-strength materials and engineering structures.

It is found that compared to the conventional constant current (CC) charging method, the PC method can accelerate the charging process but will inevitably cause an increase in stress and a decrease in capacity. The charging speed for PC method can be estimated by the mean current. By introducing stress control, a modified PC method called the PCCC method, which starts with a PC operation followed by a CC operation, is proposed. The PCCC method not only can accelerate charging process but also can avoid the stress raising and capacity loss occurring in the PC method. Furthermore, the optimal pulsed current density and switch time in the PCCC method is also discussed.

Non coupled models and the coupled models were compared regarding the horizontal displacement of the dam crest and the differential settlement of the dam base in clay foundation. Meta models were constructed and uncertainty quantification process was adopted by the support of Sobol's sensitivity indices considering five uncertain parameters by exploiting Box-Behnken experimental method. The non coupled models results determined overestimated predicted stability and damage detection in the dam. The rational effects of the reservoir height were very sensitive in the variation of the horizontal displacement of the dam crest with a small interaction effect with the beta viscous damping coefficient of the clay foundation. The modulus of elasticity of the clay foundation was the decisive parameter regarding the variation of the differential settlement of the dam base. The XFEM approach has been used for damage detection in relation with both minimum and maximum values of each uncertain parameter. Finally the effects of clay and rock foundations were determined regarding the resistance against the propagation of cracks in the dam, where the rock foundation was the best.

The laminated beam is made of perfectly bonded carbon nanotubes reinforced composite (CNTRC) layers. In each layer, single-walled carbon nanotubes are assumed to be uniformly distributed (UD) or functionally graded (FG) distributed along the thickness direction. Effective material properties of the two-phase composites, a mixture of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and an isotropic polymer, are calculated using the extended rule of mixture. The first-order shear deformation theory is used to formulate a governing equation for predicting free vibration of laminated functionally graded carbon nanotubes reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC) beams. The governing equation is solved by the finite element method with various boundary conditions. Several numerical tests are performed to investigate the influence of the CNTs volume fractions, CNTs distributions, CNTs orientation angles, boundary conditions, length-to-thickness ratios and the numbers of layers on the frequencies of the laminated FG-CNTRC beams. Moreover, a laminated composite beam combined by various distribution types of CNTs is also studied.

The two-level gradient smoothing for meshfree shape function is elaborated in the three-dimensional Lagrangian setting with detailed implementation procedure. It is shown that due to the successive gradient smoothing operation without the requirement of derivative computation in the present formulation, the two-level smoothed gradient of meshfree shape function is capable of achieving a given influence domain more efficiently than the standard gradient of meshfree shape function. Subsequently, the two-level smoothed gradient of meshfree shape function is employed to discretize the weak form of coupled rainfall seepage and soil motion equations in a nodal integration format, as provides an efficient three-dimensional regularized meshfree formulation for large deformation rainfall induced landslide simulations. The exponential damage and pressure dependent plasticity relationships are utilized to describe the failure evolution in landslides. The plastic response of soil is characterized by the true effective stress measure, which is updated according to the rotationally neutralized objective integration algorithm. The effectiveness of the present three-dimensional two-level gradient smoothing meshfree method is demonstrated through numerical examples.

The interaction between crack and microcapsule embedded in mortar matrix is modeled based on cohesive approach. The microcapsules are modelled with variation of core-shell thickness ratio and potential cracks are represented by pre-inserted cohesive elements along the element boundaries of the mortar matrix, microcapsules core, microcapsule shell, and at the interfaces between these phases. Special attention is given to the effects of cohesive fracture on the microcapsule interface, namely fracture strength, on the load carrying capacity and fracture probability of the microcapsule. The effect of fracture properties on microcapsule is found to be significant factor on the load carrying capacity and crack propagation characteristics. Regardless of core-shell thickness ratio of microcapsule, the load carrying capacity of self-healing material under tension increases as interfacial strength of microcapsule shell increases. In addition, given the fixed fracture strength of the interface of microcapsule shell, the higher the ratio core-shell thickness, the higher the probability of microcapsules being fractured.

However, its application in numerical methods, especially in developing new shape functions, has attracted much interest in recent years. These shape functions possess the potential for performing better than the conventional basis functions in problems with randomly generated coarse meshes. In this paper, the maximum entropy theory is adopted to spatially discretize the deformation variable of the governing coupled equations of porous media. This is in line with the well-known fact that higher-order shape functions can provide more stable solutions in porous problems. Some of the benchmark problems in deformable porous media are solved with the developed approach and the results are compared with available references.

This is due to the salient features of the method: 1) it can be incorporated into any conventional finite element software; 2) has a scalar damage variable is used to represent the discontinuous surface implicitly and 3) the crack initiation and subsequent propagation and branching are treated with less complexity. Within this framework, the linear momentum equations are coupled with the diffusion type equation, which describes the evolution of the damage variable. The coupled nonlinear system of partial differential equations are solved in a staggered' approach. The present work discusses the implementation of the phase field method for brittle fracture within the open-source finite element software, FEniCS. The FEniCS provides a framework for the automated solutions of the partial differential equations. The details of the implementation which forms the core of the analysis are presented. The implementation is validated by solving a few benchmark problems and comparing the results with the open literature.

The dimensionless formulation was accepted in discretization of the uncoupled and coupled thermoelasticity equations and the Generalized Newmark method was used in the time integration procedure. First, the performance of the proposed method was verified against a two-dimensional benchmark example subjected to constant thermal shock with available exact analytical solutions. Then a two-dimensional half-space benchmark example under thermal shock was solved. Finally, cyclic thermal shock (CTS) loading was applied on the half-space problem. The results dedicated that IGA can be used as a suitable approach in the analysis of the general thermomechanical problems.

The higher-order continuity of the meshfree methods such as LME and SME approximants allows to directly solve the fourth-order phase-field equations without splitting the fourth-order differential equation into two second-order differential equations.We will first show that the crack surface functional can be captured more accurately in the fourth-order model with smooth approximants such as LME, SME and B-spline. Furthermore, smaller length scale parameter is needed for the fourth-order model to approximate the energy functional.We also study SME approximants and drive the formulations. The proposed meshfree fourth-order phase-field formulation show more stable results for SME compared to LME meshfree methods.

Implementation aspects of a phase-field approach for brittle fracture	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						phase-field modeling; FEM; staggered scheme; fracture	DAMAGE; MODEL	This paper provides a comprehensive overview of a phase-field model of fracture in solid mechanics setting. We start reviewing the potential energy governing the whole process of fracture including crack initiation, branching or merging. Then, a discretization of system of equation is derived, in which the key aspect is that for the correctness of fracture phenomena, a split into tensile and compressive terms of the strain energy is performed, which allows crack to occur in tension, not in compression. For numerical analysis, standard finite element shape functions are used for both primary fields including displacements and phase field. A staggered scheme which solves the two fields of the problem separately is utilized for solution step and illustrated with a segment of Python code.	[Huynh, G.

This proposed method is used for simulation of generalized coupled thermoelasticity problems including shock (singular) waves in their solutions. The thermoelasticity problems include the LS (systems with one relaxation parameter) and GN (systems without energy dissipation) theories with constant and variable coefficients. In the central high resolution formulation, RBFs lead to a reconstruction with the optimum recovery with minimized roughness on each cell: this is essential for oscillation-free reconstructions. To guarantee monotonic reconstructions at cell-edges, the nonlinear scaling limiters are used. Such reconstructions, finally, lead to the total variation bounded (TVB) feature. As RBFs work satisfactory on non-uniform cells/grids, the proposed central scheme can handle adapted cells/grids. To have cost effective and accurate simulations, the multiresolution-based grid adaptation approach is then integrated with the RBF-based central scheme. Effects of condition numbers of RBFs, computational complexity and cost of the proposed scheme are studied. Finally, different 1-D coupled thermoelasticity benchmarks are presented. There, performance of the adaptive RBF-based formulation is compared with that of the adaptive Kurganov-Tadmor (KT) second-order central high-resolution scheme with the total variation diminishing (TVD) property.

It has a family of models carefully designed with innovative types of smoothing domains. These models are found having a number of important and theoretically profound properties. This article first provides a concise and easy-to-follow presentation of key formulations used in the S-FEM. A number of important properties and unique features of S-FEM models are discussed in detail, including 1) theoretically proven softening effects; 2) upper-bound solutions; 3) accurate solutions and higher convergence rates; 4) insensitivity to mesh distortion; 5) Jacobian-free; 6) volumetric-locking-free; and most importantly 7) working well with triangular and tetrahedral meshes that can be automatically generated. The S-FEM is thus ideal for automation in computations and adaptive analyses, and hence has profound impact on AI-assisted modeling and simulation. Most importantly, one can now purposely design an S-FEM model to obtain solutions with special properties as wish, meaning that S-FEM offers a framework for design numerical models with desired properties. This novel concept of numerical model on-demand may drastically change the landscape of modeling and simulation. Future directions of research are also provided.

In this preliminary and brief survey, elastic stress distributions in V-notched solids are discussed first. The concept of notch stress intensity factor is introduced. Combine the digital image correlation method with numerical computation techniques to analyze the stress distribution near the notches. Fracture criteria such as strain energy density, J-integral, theory of critical distance are used.However, various new materials are developed in different engineering fields, thus, the establishment of reliable and accurate material strength theory or failure criterion is imperative. Therefore, predicting fracture for various modern materials would require more experiments to infer material dependent parameters in the local fracture model.

Recent experimental study (Sci.

We accordingly conducted first-principles calculations to explore the mechanical and electronic responses of not only ZrSe2 and HfSe2, but also ZrS2 and HfS2 in their single-layer and free-standing form. We particularly studied the possibility of engineering of the electronic properties of these attractive 2D materials using the biaxial or uniaxial tensile loadings. The comprehensive insight provided concerning the intrinsic properties of HfS2, HfSe2, ZrS2, and ZrSe2 can be useful for their future applications in nanodevices.

The objective of this study is to investigate the mechanical properties of this new graphene like 2D material. In this work, mechanical properties of phagraphene have been studied not only in the defect-free form, but also with the critical defect of line cracks, using the classical molecular dynamics simulations. Our study shows that the pristine phagraphene in zigzag direction experience a ductile behavior under uniaxial tensile loading and the nanosheet in this direction are less sensitive to temperature changes as compared to the armchair direction. We studied different crack lengths to explore the influence of defects on the mechanical properties of phagraphene. We also investigated the temperature effect on the mechanical properties of pristine and defective phagraphene. Our classical atomistic simulation results confirm that larger cracks can reduce the strength of the phagraphene. Moreover, it was shown the temperature has a considerable weakening effect on the tensile strength of phagraphene. The results of this study may be useful for the design of nano-devices using the phagraphene.

The finite element (FE) developed code are used to build three-dimensional (3D) finite element models of concrete dams. A fully coupled Euler-Lagrange formulation has been adopted herein. A previous developed model including the strain rate effects is employed to model the concrete material behavior subjected to blast loading. In addition, a one-fluid cavitating model is employed for the simulation of acoustic cavitation in the fluid domain. A parametric study is conducted to evaluate the effects of the air blast loading on the response of concrete dam systems. Hence, the analyses are performed for different heights of dam and different values of the charge distance from the charge center. Numerical results revealed that 1) concrete arch dams are more vulnerable to air blast loading than concrete gravity dams; 2) reservoir has mitigation effect on the response of concrete dams; 3) acoustic cavitation intensify crest displacement of concrete dams.

It represents the stress-strain relationship in the elastic range and is used in the prediction of concrete structures. Out of range estimation of MOE in the existing codes of practice strongly affect the design and performance of the concrete structures. This study includes: (a) evaluation and comparison of the existing analytical models to estimating the MOE in normal strength concrete, and (b) proposing and verifying a new model. In addition, a wide range of experimental databases and empirical models to estimate the MOE from compressive strength and density of concrete are evaluated to verification of the proposed model. The results show underestimation of MOE of conventional concrete in majority of the existing models. Also, considering the consistency between density and mechanical properties of concrete, the predicted MOE in the models including density effect, are more compatible with the experimental results.

Hot-dip galvanizing of cold-formed steel hollow sections: a state-of-the-art review	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Review						cold-formed steel; hollow structural sections; hot-dip galvanizing; embrittlement; heat-treatment; residual stress; cracking	COLUMN BEHAVIOR; TOUGHNESS; SQUARE	A good understanding of the effects of galvanizing on the short- and long-term behaviours of steel components is essential for structural design. This review paper is motivated by a series of recent reports on cracking in galvanized cold-formed tubular steel structures and the limitations of current steel product standards and steel design specifications in this field. The steel-related and galvanizing-related factors, different pre-galvanizing countermeasures for brittle cracking and the available technical documents are summarized. An extensive bibliography is provided as a basis for future research and development in this field.

J	Sekhavatian, A; Choobbasti, AJ				Sekhavatian, Arash; Choobbasti, Asskar Janalizadeh			Application of random set method in a deep excavation: based on a case study in Tehran cemented alluvium	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						uncertainty; reliability analysis; deep excavations; random set method; finite difference method	STOCHASTIC PREDICTIONS; NANOCOMPOSITES; RELIABILITY; FRAMEWORK	The design of high-rise buildings often necessitates ground excavation, where buildings are in close proximity to the construction, thus there is a potential for damage to these structures. This paper studies an efficient user-friendly framework for dealing with uncertainties in a deep excavation in layers of cemented coarse grained soil located in Tehran, Iran by non-deterministic Random Set (RS) method. In order to enhance the acceptability of the method among engineers, a pertinent code was written in FISH language of FLAC2D software which enables the designers to run all simulations simultaneously, without cumbersome procedure of changing input variables in every individual analysis. This could drastically decrease the computational effort and cost imposed to the project, which is of great importance especially to the owners. The results are presented in terms of probability of occurrence and most likely values of the horizontal displacement at top of the wall at every stage of construction. Moreover, a methodology for assessing the credibility of the uncertainty model is presented using a quality indicator. It was concluded that performing RS analysis before the beginning of every stage could cause great economical savings, while improving the safety of the project.

J	Faruqi, M; Khan, MS				Faruqi, Mohammed; Khan, Mohammed Sheroz			Deflection behavior of a prestressed concrete beam reinforced with carbon fibers at elevated temperatures	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						FRP; CFRP; concrete; elevated temperatures; deflections; prestress	CRACK-GROWTH; FRP	Fiber reinforced polymer(FRP) have unique advantages like high strength to weight ratio, excellent corrosion resistance, improving deformability and cost effectiveness. These advantages have gained wide acceptance in civil engineering applications. FRP tendons for prestressing applications are emerging as one of the most promising technologies in the civil engineering industry. However, the behavior of such members under the influence of elevated temperatures is still unknown. The knowledge and application of this could lead to a cost effective and practical considerations in fire safety design. Therefore, this study examines the deflection behavior of the carbon fiber reinforced polymer(CFRP) prestressed concrete beam at elevated temperatures. In this article, an analytical model is developed which integrates the temperature dependent changes of effective modulus of FRP in predicting the deflection behavior of CFRP prestressed concrete beams within the range of practical temperatures. This model is compared with a finite element mode (FEM) of a simply supported concrete beam prestressed with CFRP subjected to practical elevated temperatures. In addition, comparison is also made with an indirect reference to the real behavior of the material. The results of the model correlated reasonably with the finite element model and the real behavior. Finally, a practical application is provided.

J	Van, CN				Chung Nguyen Van			Numerical investigation of circle defining curve for two-dimensional problem with general boundaries using the scaled boundary finite element method	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						exact geometry; circular defining curve; general boundaries; SBFEM	SHAPE FUNCTIONS	The scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is applied to the static analysis of two dimensional elasticity problem, boundary value problems domain with the domain completely described by a circular defining curve. The scaled boundary finite element equations is formulated within a general framework integrating the influence of the distributed body force, general boundary conditions, and bounded and unbounded domain. This paper investigates the possibility of using exact geometry to form the exact description of the circular defining curve and the standard finite element shape function to approximate the defining curve. Three linear elasticity problems are presented to verify the proposed method with the analytical solution. Numerical examples show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, and the performance is found to be better than using standard linear element for the approximation defining curve on the scaled boundary method.

Classical solution of Boussinesq theory was used originally to develop the Fox depth correction factor equations which were rather complex in nature. The equations were later simplified in the form of graphs and tables and referred in various international code of practices and standard texts for an unsophisticated and quick analysis. However, these tables and graphs provide the factor only for limited values of the input variables and hence again complicates the process of automation of analysis. Therefore, this paper presents a non-linear regression model for the analysis of effect of embedment developed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. Through multiple iterations, the value of coefficient of determination is found to reach 0.987. The equation is straightforward, competent and easy to use for both manual and automated calculation of the Fox depth correction factor for wide range of input values. Using the developed equation, parametric study is also conducted in the later part of the paper to analyse the extent of effect of a particular variable on the Fox depth factor.

The strength contributed by the AC overlay is strongly influenced by the anisotropic properties of the pavement material. This study was conducted to analyze the influence of anisotropy, modulus gradient properties, and the condition of the AC overlay and old pavement contact plane on the mechanical behaviors of AC overlays, as well as to quantify the influence of the degree of anisotropy on the mechanical behaviors of AC overlay by a sensitivity analysis (SA). The mechanical behaviors of the AC overlay were numerically obtained using the three-dimensional finite element method with the aid of ABAQUS, a commercial program. Variations in the AC overlay's modulus as a function of temperature as well as the contact state between the AC overlay and AC layer were considered. The SA is based on standardized regression coefficients method. Comparing the mechanical behavior in terms of surface deflection, stress, and strain of the anisotropy model against those corresponding to the isotropic model under static loads show that the anisotropic properties had greater effects on the mechanical behavior of the AC overlay. In addition, the maximum shear stress in the AC overlay was the most significant output parameter affected by the degree of anisotropy. Therefore, future research concerning the reinforcement and repair of pavements should consider the anisotropic properties of the pavement materials.

It is considered as a two-phase optimization approach, where at the first phase, the first local optimum is found by few analyses, after the whole searching space is limited employing an efficient random strategy, and the second phase involves finding a sequence of local optimum points using the variables sensitivity with respect to corresponding values of constraints violation. To reach the global solution at phase two, a sequence of two sensitivity-based operators of border-search operator and jump operator are introduced until convergence is occurred. Sensitivity analysis is performed using numerical finite difference method. To do structural analysis, a link between open source software of OpenSees and MATLAB was developed. Spatial truss problems were attempted for optimization in order to show the fastness and efficiency of proposed technique. Results were compared with those reported in the literature. It shows that the proposed method is competitive with the other optimization methods with a significant reduction in number of analyses carried.

Dynamic in-plane transversal normal stresses in the concrete face of CFRD	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						CFR dams; dynamic analysis; in-plane normal stresses; concrete face	STOCHASTIC PREDICTIONS; ROCKFILL MATERIALS; SEISMIC RESPONSE; FRAMEWORK; NANOCOMPOSITES; BEHAVIOR; DAMS	Severe earthquakes can induce damages to Concrete Face Rockfill Dams (CFRDs) such as concrete cracking and joint's water stops distressing where high in-plane transversal normal stresses develop. Although these damages rarely jeopardize the dam safety, they cause large water reservoir leakages that hinder the dam functioning. This issue can be addressed using well know numerical methods; however, given the wide range of parameters involved, it would seem appropriate to develop a simple yet reliable procedure to get a close understanding how their interaction affects the CFRD's overall behavior. Accordingly, once the physics of the problem is better understood one can proceed to perform a detailed design of the various components of the dam. To this end an easy-to-use procedure that accounts for the dam height effects, valley narrowness, valley slopes, width of concrete slabs and seismic excitation characteristics was developed. The procedure is the dynamic complement of a method recently developed to evaluate in-plane transversal normal stresses in the concrete face of CFRD's due to dam reservoir filling [1]. Using these two procedures in a sequential manner, it is possible to define the concrete slab in-plane normal stresses induced by the reservoir filling and the action of orthogonal horizontal seismic excitations acting at the same time upstream-downstream and cross river. Both procedures were developed from a data base generated using nonlinear static and dynamic three-dimensional numerical analyses on the same group of CFRD's. Then, the results were interpreted with the Buckingham Pi theorem and various relationships were developed. In the above reference, the method to evaluate the concrete face in-plane transversal normal stresses caused by the first reservoir filling was reported. In this paper, the seismic procedure is first developed and then through an example the whole method (dam construction, reservoir filling plus seismic loading) of analysis is assessed.

The bridge has three continuous spans supported by two single-column piers and integral abutments founded on drilled shafts. It will be the first full-scale highway bridge to use superelastic shape memory alloy bars (SMA) and engineered cementitious composite (ECC) to mitigate column plastic hinge damage and minimize residual displacements after a strong earthquake. A three-dimensional computational model capturing the nonlinear constitutive response of the novel materials and the effects of dynamic soil-structure interaction was developed to assess the seismic response of the bridge in finite-element software OpenSees. Two versions of the same bridge were analyzed and compared, one with conventional cast-in-place reinforced concrete columns, and the other with top plastic hinges incorporating Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) SMA reinforcing bars and ECC. The novel SMA/ECC plastic hinges were found to substantially reduce damage and post-earthquake residual displacements in the bridge substructure, but led to larger maximum drifts relative to the bridge with conventional reinforced concrete plastic hinges. The analysis results suggested that the novel plastic hinges could lead to improved post-earthquake serviceability of bridges after intense earthquakes.

Such concrete pipes play a major role in tunneling and underground engineering. The structure is modelled fully in 3D using three-dimensional continuum elements for the concrete structure which beam elements are employed to model the reinforcement. This allows the method to capture important phenomena compared to a pure shell model of concrete. A continuous approach to fracture is chosen when concrete is subjected to compressive loading while a combined continuous-discrete fracture method is employed in tension. The model is validated through comparisons with experimental data.

Adding the fictitious inertia and damping forces to the static equation, and turning it to the dynamic system, are the basis of this technique. Proper selection of the DRM artificial factors leads to the better convergence rate and efficient solutions. This study aims to increase the numerical stability, and to decrease the analysis time. To fulfil this objective, the reduction rate of analysis error for consecutive iterations is minimized. Based on this formulation, a new time step is found for the viscous dynamic relaxation. After combining this novel relationship with the other DRM factors, various geometrical nonlinear structures, such as trusses, frames, and shells, are analyzed. The obtained results verify the efficiency of authors' scheme.

Fifty-mm-diameter specimens of two different fiber types were scanned both before and after load testing. From the CT images, fiber orientation was evaluated to establish optimum and pessimum specimen orientations, at which fibers would have maximum and minimum effect, respectively. As expected, fiber orientation affected both the peak load and the toughness of the specimen, with the optimum toughness being between 20% and 30% higher than the pessimum. Cumulative AE energy was also affected commensurately. Posttest CT scans of the specimens were used to measure internal damage. Damage was quantified in terms of internal energy dissipation due to both matrix cracking and fiber pullout by using calibration measurements for each. The results showed that fiber pullout was the dominant energy dissipation mechanism; however, the sum of the internal energy dissipation measured amounted to only 60% of the total energy dissipated by the specimens as measured by the net work of load. It is postulated that localized compaction of the UHPC matrix as well as internal friction between fractured fragments makes up the balance of internal energy dissipation.

The scaled boundary finite element formulation is established in a general framework allowing single-field and multi-field problems, bounded and unbounded bodies, distributed body source, and general boundary conditions to be treated in a unified fashion. The conventional polar coordinates together with a properly selected scaling center are utilized to achieve the exact description of the circular defining curve, exact geometry of the domain, and exact spatial differential operators. Standard finite element shape functions are employed in the discretization of both trial and test functions in the circumferential direction and the resulting eigenproblem is solved by a selected efficient algorithm. The computational performance of the implemented procedure is then fully investigated for various scenarios to demonstrate the accuracy in comparison with standard linear elements.

This paper aims to explore two machine learning algorithms including artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) to predict the compressive strength of bentonite/sepiolite plastic concretes. For this purpose, two unique sets of 72 data for compressive strength of bentonite and sepiolite plastic concrete samples (totally 144 data) were prepared by conducting an experimental study. The results confirm the ability of ANN and SVM models in prediction processes. Also, Sensitivity analysis of the best obtained model indicated that cement and silty clay have the maximum and minimum influences on the compressive strength, respectively. In addition, investigation of the effect of measurement error of input variables showed that change in the sand content (amount) and curing time will have the maximum and minimum effects on the output mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of model, respectively. Finally, the influence of different variables on the plastic concrete compressive strength values was evaluated by conducting parametric studies.

We assume viscous fluids and the coupling equations are derived from the mass and momentum balance equations for saturated porous media. The fluid flow through discrete cracks will be modelled by the extended finite element method and an implicit time integration scheme. We also present a consistent linearization of the underlying non-linear discrete equations. They are solved by the Newton-Raphson iteration procedure in combination with a line search. Furthermore, the model is extended to includes crack propagation. Finally, examples are presented to demonstrate the versatility and efficiency of this two-scale hydromechanical model. The results suggest that the presence of the fracture in a deforming, porous media has great impact on the fluid flow and deformation patterns.

Research in industry and science aims to extend forward the use of non-linear calculation of fiber concrete for structural parts such as columns, veils and pious, as the fiber concrete is more ductile behavior then the classical concrete behavior. The formulation of the element has been established for modeling the nonlinear behavior of elastic structures in three dimensions, based on the displacement method. For the behavior of concrete and fiber concrete compressive and tensile strength (stress-strain) the uniaxial formulation is used. For steel bi-linear relationship is used. The approach is based on the discretization of the cross section trapezoidal tables. Forming the stiffness matrix of the section, the integral of the surface is calculated as the sum of the integrals on each of the cutting trapezoids. To integrate on the trapeze we have adopted the type of Simpson integration scheme.

The other parameters included in the investigation are water/cement (w/c) ratio, sand gradation and embedment length of fibres. In addition, the type of failure of sisal and coir fibres for different mixes of mortars at various curing ages is also reported. From the results, it is seen that the bond strength is improving with respect to age of curing in case of sisal fibres, but decreases in case of coir fibres. The failure of fibres due to fibre fracture is observed in sisal fibres and fibre pullout is observed in coir fibres. The other varying parameters such as mortar mixes, sand gradation, w/c ratio and embedded length also showed significant effect on bond behaviour of sisal and coir fibre with the cement mortar mixes.

The elastic property of RAC contains uncertainties across scales. It has both theoretical and practical values to model and predict its mechanical performance. Based on homogenization theory, effective stochastic elastic moduli of RAC at three different scales are obtained using moving window technique, nano-indentation digital images, and Monte-Carlo method. It involves the generation of a large number of random realizations of microstructure geometry based on different volume fraction of the inclusions and other parameters. The mean value, coefficient of variation and probability distribution of the effective elastic moduli are computed considering the material multiscale structure. The microscopic randomness is taken into account, and correlations of RAC among five phases are investigated. The effective elastic properties are used to obtain the global behavior of a composite structure. It is indicated that the response variability can be considerably affected by replacement percentage of recycled aggregates.

On demand, the unit is moved and installed in a given location and used for a period up to 12 months before being un-installed and moved to another location. Due to its mobility and re-usability, when the unit is offered for use in a given offshore location, its suitability in terms of safe operation is evaluated in accordance with the guidelines of Site Specific Assessment (SSA) of jack up. When the unit failed safety assessment criteria, the guideline recommended that it is re-assessed by increasing the complexity of the assumptions and methods used. Reliability analysis theories are one of the frameworks recommended for the safety assessment of the units.With recent developments in uncertainty and reliability analysis of structures subject to stochastic excitation, this study aims at providing a review on the past developments in jack up reliability analysis and to identify possible future directions. The results from literature reviewed shows that failure probabilities vary significantly with analysis method used. In addition, from the variants of reliability analysis approach, the method of time dependent reliability for dynamic structures subject to stochastic excitation have not been implemented on jack ups. Consequently, suggestions were made on the areas that need further examination for improvement of the efficiency in safety assessment of the units using reliability theories.

However, many research studies conducted across the US have reported mixed observations regarding its effects on the initial quality and long-term performance of asphalt pavements.The objective of this study was to determine the effects of the temperature segregation on the density and mechanical properties of Louisiana asphalt mixtures. Seven asphalt rehabilitation projects across Louisiana were selected. A multisensor infrared bar (Pave-IR) system and a hand-held portable thermal camera were used to measure the temperature of asphalt mats. Field core samples were collected from various areas with varying severity levels of temperature segregation and tested for the density, fracture resistance (J(c)) by semi-circular bending (SCB), rut depth by wheel tracking, and dynamic modulus (|E*|) by indirect tension (IDT) devices.Two distinctive patterns of non-uniform temperature distribution were observed: a cyclic and irregular temperature segregations. Laboratory test results showed that highly temperature segregated asphalt pavements (i.e., temperature differentials 41.7 degrees C) can have significantly lower densities and the mechanical properties than the non-segregated area, especially when the temperature differentials are measured at compaction.

The principle of Hasofer-Lind can be applied, in first approach, for the reliability index estimation, scenarios and the probability of failure.The made check concerned metallic in truss structures.

When the relative deformation of the PD bond between the particles reaches the critical crack tip opening displacement of the fracture mechanics, we assume that the bond force vanishes. A new damage rule similar to the local damage rule in conventional PD is introduced to simulate fracture. The new formulation is developed for a linear elastic solid though the extension to nonlinear materials is straightforward. The performance of the new fracture criterion is demonstrated by four examples, i.e. a bilateral crack problem, double parallel crack, monoclinic crack and the double inclined crack. The results are compared to experimental data and the results obtained by other computational methods.

In this research, two modeling methods including mechanical and neural network methods have been presented in order to model the complex hysteresis behavior of beam-to-column connections with flange plate. First, the component-based mechanical model will be introduced in which every source of transformation has been shown only with geometrical and material properties. This is followed by the investigation of a neural network method for direct extraction of information out of experimental data. For the validation of behavioral curves as well as training of the neural network, the experiments were carried out on samples with real dimensions of beam-to-column connections with flange plate in the laboratory. At the end, the combinational modeling framework is presented. The comparisons reveal that the combinational modeling is able to display the complex narrowed hysteresis behavior of the beam-to-column connections with flange plate. This model has also been successfully employed for the prediction of the behavior of a newly designed connection.

The magnetic flux (MF) examination shows great potential to detect the corrosion defect, or loss of metallic cross-sectional area (LMA). An LMA defect in steel cables can be measured accurately when it is longer than a certain length. However, for defects in early stage, where the length of corrosion area is short, the MF examination may produce unacceptable error. In this study, the effect of defect length on the MF examination for corrosion detection of bridge cables is investigated through theoretical analysis and model experiments. An original analytical model to quantify the influence of defect length is proposed based on the equivalent magnetic circuit method. Then, MF examination experiments are performed on a series of cable models with different defect lengths and locations to verify the analytical model. Further, parameter study is conducted based on the proposed analytical model to clarify the mechanism of the defect-length effect. The results show that the area loss caused by short corrosion damage will be underestimated if the defect-length effect is neglected, and this effect can be quantified efficiently with the proposed analytical model.

Representative RAC models are randomly generated with various distribution of aggregates. Based on homogenization theory, effects of recycled aggregate replacement rate, aggregate volume fraction, the unevenness of old mortar, proportion of old mortar, aggregate size and elastic modulus of aggregates on overall variability of equivalent elastic properties are investigated. Results are in a good agreement with experimental data in literature and finite pixel-element method saves the computation cost. It is indicated that the effect of mesoscopic randomness on global variability of elastic properties is considerable.

The investigations were done on 84 SIFCON mixes, and specimens were cast and tested after 28 days curing. The obtained experimental data are trained using ANN which consists of 4 input parameters like Percentage of fiber (PF), Aspect Ratio (AR), Type of admixture (TA) and Percentage of admixture (PA). The corresponding output parameters are compressive strength, tensile strength and flexural strength. The predicted values obtained using ANN show a good correlation between the experimental data. The performance of the 4-14-3 architecture was better than other architectures. It is concluded that ANN is a highly powerful tool suitable for assessing the strength characteristics of SIFCON.

Dynamic crack propagation in plates weakened by inclined cracks: an investigation based on peridynamics	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						peridynamics; inclined crack; dynamic fracture; crack branching	MESHFREE METHOD	Peridynamics is a theory in solid mechanics that uses integral equations instead of partial differential equations as governing equations. It can be applied to fracture problems in contrast to the approach of fracture mechanics. In this paper by using peridynamics, the crack path for inclined crack under dynamic loading were investigated. The peridynamics solution for this problem represents the main features of dynamic crack propagation such as crack bifurcation. The problem is solved for various angles and different stress values. In addition, the influence of geometry on inclined crack growth is studied. The results are compared with molecular dynamic solutions that seem to show reasonable agreement in branching position and time.

The fracture criterion is implicitly incorporated in the PD theory and fracture is a natural outcome of the simulation. However, capturing of complex mixed-mode crack patterns has been proven to be difficult with PD. On the other hand, the extended finite element method (XFEM) is one of the most popular methods for fracture which allows crack propagation with minimal remeshing. It requires a fracture criterion which is independent of the underlying discretization though a certain refinement is needed in order to obtain suitable results. This article presents a comparative study between XFEM and PD. Therefore, two examples are studied. The first example is crack propagation in a double notched specimen under uniaxial tension with different crack spacings in loading direction. The second example is the specimens with two center cracks. The results show that PD as well as XFEM are well suited to capture this type of behaviour.

For a 10-span simply-supported U-shaped girder bridge with 100 m long double-side 3.5 m barrier, the response and the running safety indices of the train are calculated. The results are compared with those of the case with wind barrier on the whole bridge. It is shown that the sudden change of wind load caused by wind barrier has significant influence on the lateral acceleration of the car-body, but no distinct on the vertical acceleration. The running safety indices of train vehicle with sectional wind barriers are worse than those with full wind barriers, and the difference increases rapidly with wind velocity.

After simulating the three compacting proposals carried out on the field test, the study uses COMSOL software to research on the compacting effects of sand-filled layers in larger thicknesses by 22 ton vibratory roller alone, and then to investigate the steady compacting effect of 12 ton vibratory roller. The simulation results indicate that the sand-filled layer thickness of 70 cm is suitable for the new sand filling technique, and the sand-filled embankment project with tight construction period is suggested to choose the 12 ton vibration roller for steady compaction.

In this paper, an empirical model based on the product-unit neural network (PUNN) is developed to predict the load-deformation behaviour of piles based SPT values of the supporting soil. Other parameters used as inputs include particle grading, pile geometry, method of installation as well as the elastic modulus of the pile material. The model is trained using full-scale pile loading tests data retrieved from FHWA deep foundations database. From the results obtained, it is observed that the proposed model gives a better simulation of pile load-deformation curves compared to the Fleming's hyperbolic model and t-z approach.

Numerical simulations of TFSI models of the deck are dedicated to calculate the lift and drag forces in addition to determining the lock-in regions once using fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models and another using TFSI models. Vorticity and thermal convection fields of three fire scenarios are simulated and analyzed. Simiu and Scanlan benchmark is used to validate the TFSI models, where a good agreement was manifested between the two results. Extended finite element method (XFEM) is adopted to create 3D models of the cable stayed bridge to simulate the fatigue of the deck considering three fire scenarios. Choi and Shin benchmark is used to validate the damaged models of the deck in which a good coincide was seen between them. The results revealed that TFSI models and coupled thermal-stress models are significant in detecting earlier vortex induced vibration and lock-in regions in addition to predicting damages and fatigue of the deck due to fire incidents.

It is of great feasibility to construct structural components and buildings by means of 3D concrete printing. The major issues of this innovative technique focus on the preparation and optimization of concrete materials which possess favourable printable properties as well as the measurement and evaluation methods of their workability. This paper firstly introduces three largescale 3D printing systems that have been successfully applied in construction industry. It then summarizes the commonly used raw materials in concrete manufacturing. Critical factors that should be particularly controlled in material preparation are specified. Easy-extrusive, easy-flowing, well-buildable, proper setting time and low shrinkage are significant for concrete mixture to meet the critical requirements of a freeform construction process. Thereafter, measuring methods that can be employed to assess the fresh and hardened properties of concrete at early stages are suggested. Finally, a few of evaluation methods are presented which may offer certain assistance for optimizing material preparation. The objective of this work is to review current design methodologies and experimental measurement and evaluation methods for 3D printable concrete materials and promote its responsible use with largescale 3D printing technology.

The governing equations of the present model are the Navier-Stocks equations solved using Weakly Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH) method. To simulate the movement of sediment particles, the model considers a powerful two-part technique; when the sediment phase has rigid behavior, only the force term due to shear stress in the Navier-Stokes equations is used for simulation of sediment particles' movement. Otherwise, all the Navier-Stokes force terms are used for transport simulation of sediment particles. In the present model, the interactions between different phases are calculated automatically, even with considerable difference between the density and viscosity of phases. Validation of the model is performed using simulation of available laboratory experiments, and the comparison between computational results and experimental data shows that the model generally predicts well the flow propagation over movable beds, the induced sediment transport and bed changes, and temporal evolution of embankment breaching.

In this piece of research, an ordinary three dimensional reinforced concrete building is selected as case study. The building is located in an earthquake-prone region; however, it is designed according to seismic building codes. Yet, it is not shielded against abnormal loads, such as blasts. It is assumed that the building suffers a blast load, due to mechanical/thermal installation failure during or after intense seismic oscillations. These two critical incidents are regarded codependent and compatible. So the researchers developed scenarios and tried to assess different probabilities for each scenario and carried out an analysis to ensure if progressive collapse had set in or not. In the first step, two analysis models were used for each scenario; a non-linear dynamic time history analysis and a blast local dynamic analysis. In the second step, having the structural destructions of the first step in view, a pushdown analysis was carried out to determine the severity of progressive collapse and assess building robustness. Finally, the annual probability of structural collapse under simultaneous earthquake and blast loads was estimated and offered.

This study focused on the evaluation of the most factors influencing compatibility between the repair material and the base concrete including mechanicals properties such as, compressive and flexural strengths, elastic modulus, capillary absorption and drying shrinkage. The experimental results showed that natural pozzolan reduces the compressive strength and the flexural strength of ECC at all ages. The elastic modulus of ECC was remarkably lower than that of normal-strength concrete. This lower Young's modulus is desirable for repair concrete, because it prevents the stresses induced by restrained shrinkage. In addition, the incorporation of high-volume natural pozzolan decreases significantly the coefficient of capillary absorption at long term and increases the drying shrinkage. Generally, based on the results obtained in the present experimental investigation, ECC can be used effectively as an overlay material over existing parent concrete.

The authorities went on to restructuring of the building stock, using a structural system that is most like what is known today as confined masonry. They designed about 14 types of one- to two-storey buildings providing the engineers with detailed construction plans. These buildings are known as "Arogi" buildings (Arogi in Greek meaning Aid). On the 24th of January and 3rd of February 2014, two earthquakes of magnitude 6.1 and 6.0 struck the island, causing significant soil damages, developing excessively high ground accelerations. Surprisingly, no damage was reported in the "Arogi" buildings. The seismic behavior of the buildings is examined by FEM linear analysis and it is compared to that of URM structures. Computed results illustrate that the displacements of identical URM buildings would be about twice the magnitudes observed in the corresponding "Arogi" ones, with the implication that the earthquake sequence of 2014 would have caused critical damage should the type of structure be of the URM type. Furthermore, it is illustrated that this low cost alternative method of construction is a very effective means of producing earthquake resilient structures, whereas further reduction of seismic displacement may be achieved in the order of 50% with commensurate effects on damage potential, when reinforced slabs are used to replace the timber roofs.

Pavement Management System (PMS) has demonstrated to be an essential tool for proper management of infrastructure and proper utilization of available funds. The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga utilized Micropaver software as PMS tool to conduct a pavement management analysis of principal arterials in the City of Chattanooga. The study used the City of Chattanooga pavement database to create the current and future pavement conditions. Maintenance and repair (M&R) planning analysis was also performed in order to determine the most cost-effective treatment and suggest the optimum utilization of funds for the city. An analysis of five budget scenarios was conducted for a five-year plan using the critical pavement condition index (PCI) method (ASTM D6433). Results show that the backlog elimination budget would be the best scenario because it increases the pavement condition and eliminates the backlog of major maintenance and repairs over the five-year period. The unlimited budget seems though ideal, it does not improve pavement condition. Maintaining current condition and limited budget scenarios would increase both the backlog and the total cost of maintenance and repairs over the analysis period.

The wind pressure distributions on gable roofs of low-rise buildings are investigated by a series of wind tunnel tests which consist of 99 test cases with various roof pitches, height-depth ratios and width-depth ratios. The block pressure coefficients and worst negative (block) pressure coefficients on different roof regions of low-rise buildings are proposed for the main structure and building envelope, respectively. The effects of roof pitch, height-depth ratio, and width-depth ratio on the pressure coefficients of each region are analyzed in detail. In addition, the pressure coefficients on the roofs for the main structure and building envelope are fitted according to roof pitch, height-depth ratio and width-depth ratio of the low-rise building. Meanwhile, the rationality of the fitting formulas is verified by comparing the fitting results with the codes of different countries. Lastly, the block pressure coefficients and worst negative pressure coefficients are recommended to guide the design of low-rise buildings in typhoon area and act as references for the future's modification of wind load codes.

A finite element model is proposed in this study, using the TAKEDA modified behavior model with Timoshenko beams elements. This model is validated initially on experimental model. Then the work has focused on the behavior of a RC frame with 3 levels and three bays to better visualize the behavior of plastic hinges. Once the plastic hinge control parameters are identified (plastic rotation, ultimate curvature), a strengthening by introduction of reinforced concrete walls (RC/wall) at the ends of the reinforced concrete frame (RC/frame) has been performed. The results show that these RC walls significantly improve the behavior, by a relocation of efforts towards the central part of the beams.

To investigate the effect of chloride ions on the corrosion of lining concretes under sulfate attack, ultrasonic detecting, compression test and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) were performed on the concretes to obtain the ultrasonic velocity, corrosion thickness, compression strength and corrosion products. The ultrasonic results, compression strength and XRD patterns confirmed that the existence of chloride certainly depressed the corrosion damage on the lining concretes under sulfate attack, and the depressing effect increased with the content of chloride in the composite solution. The corrosion damage on the concretes experienced three stages independent of the composition of corrosive solution: initial slower enhancement on the strength, stabilization period and linear degradation period. The existence of chloride mainly affected the final degradation stage and obviously decreased the corrosion thickness.

Deflections of towers with joint slippage effects is up to 1.9 times greater than the displacements obtained by linear analytical methods. In this study, 8 different types of joints are modelled and studied in the finite element program, and the results are verified by the experimental results which have been done in the laboratory. Moreover, several types of joints have been modelled and studied and load-deformation curves have also been presented. Finally, joint slip data for different types of angles, bolt diameter and bolt arrangements are generated. Thereupon, damping ratios (zeta) for different types of connections are reported. The study can be useful to help in designing of wind turbine towers with a higher level of accuracy and safety.

In recent years there has been an increased interest in the use of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) materials. However, the flexure behavior of a hybrid system reinforced by the combination of pre-stressed steel and glass fiber reinforced (GFRP) is still relatively unknown. The purpose of this work is to study this. Two slabs of 100 and 150-millimeter thickness, with a span of 2.1 m reinforced with both pre-stressing steel and GFRP were constructed and tested to failure using ACI 318-11 and ACI 440.1R-15. The concrete had strength of 31 MPa and the slabs were respectively reinforced with 5#4 bars and 3#5 bars. Each slab had 37.41 mm(2) prestressing wire with a failure stress of 1722.5 MPa. The experimental flexural strength and deflection of slabs were compared with their respective sizes theoretical slabs. The theoretical slabs were either reinforced with pre-stressed steel or GFRP rebars, or a hybrid system. It was found that the hybrid system produces better results.

Therefore, a thorough knowledge of mineral composition is essential to predict the optimum engineering properties of the soil, which is generally characterized by different indices like maximum dry density (MDD), California bearing ratio (CBR), unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and free swelling index (FSI). In this article, a novel multiattribute decision making (MADM) based approach of mix design has been proposed for silty sand-artificial clay mix to improve the characteristic strength of a soil subgrade. Experimental investigation has been carried out in this study to illustrate the proposed approach of selecting appropriate proportion for the soil mix to optimize all the above mentioned engineering properties simultaneously. The results show that a mix proportion containing approximately 90% silty sand plus 10% bentonite soil is the optimal combination in context to the present study. The proposed methodology for optimal decision making to choose appropriate combination of bentonite and silty sand is general in nature and therefore, it can be extended to other problems of selecting mineral compositions.

However, the current asphalt mixture design procedure does not directly consider friction as a requirement. The objective of this study was to develop a surface friction prediction model that can be used during a wearing course mixture design. To achieve the objective, an experimental study was conducted on the frictional characteristics of typical wearing course mixtures in Louisiana. Twelve wearing course mixtures including dense-graded and open-graded mixes with different combinations of aggregate sources were evaluated in laboratory using an accelerated polishing and testing procedure considering both micro-and macro texture properties. In addition, the surface frictional properties of asphalt mixtures were measured on twenty-two selected asphalt pavement sections using different in situ devices including Dynamic Friction Tester (DFT), Circular Texture Meter (CTM), and Lock-Wheel Skid Trailer (LWST). The results have led to develop a procedure for predicting pavement end-of-life skid resistance based on the aggregate blend polish stone value, gradation parameters, and traffic, which is suited in checking whether the selected aggregates in a wearing course mix design would meet field friction requirements under a certain design traffic polishing.

However, the possibilities of pylon plastic behavior were revealed in recent earthquake damages. The lack of due diligence in the nonlinear seismic behavior of the pylon has caused a blurry understanding about the seismic performance of such widely built though less strong earthquake experienced structures. In light of this point, a 1/20 scaled concrete pylon model which from a typical medium span cable-stayed bridge was designed and tested on the shaking table longitudinally. The dynamic response and seismic behavior of the pylon were measured, evaluated and compared to reveal its vulnerable parts and nonlinear seismic performance. The results show that most parts of the concrete pylon remain elastic even under very strong excitations, which means a sufficient safety margin for current pylon longitudinal design. The most vulnerable parts of the pylon appeared first at the pylon bottom region, cracks opening and closing at the pylon bottom were observed during the test, and then extended to the lower column and middle column around the lower strut.

This paper develops a mathematical multi-linear regression analysis (MLRA) model to determine a pavement sustainability index (PSTI) as dependent variable for flexible pavements in Maryland. Four categories of pavement performance evaluation indicators are subdivided into seven pavement condition indices and analyzed as independent variables for each section of pavement. Data are collected from five different roadways using field evaluations and existing database. Results indicate that coefficient of determination (R-2) is correlated and significant, R-2 = 0.959. Of the seven independent variables, present serviceability index (PSI) is the most significant with a coefficient value of 0.032, present serviceability rating (PSR) coefficient value = 0.028, and international roughness index (IRI) coefficient value = -0.001. Increasing each unit value of coefficients for PSI and PSR would increase the value of PSTI; thereby providing a more sustainable pavement infrastructure; which explains the significance of the model and why IRI will most likely impact environmental, economic and social values.

Currently it is common to conduct such measurements in a stationary manner, however the evaluation with stationary loading does not correspond to reality a tendency towards continuous and high speed measurements in recent years can be observed. The computational program SAFEM was developed with the objective of evaluating the dynamic response of asphalt under moving loads and is based on a semi-analytic element method. In this research project SAFEM is compared to commercial finite element software ABAQUS and field measurements to verify the computational accuracy. The computational accuracy of SAFEM was found to be high enough to be viable whilst boasting a computational time far shorter than ABAQUS. Thus, SAFEM appears to be a feasible approach to determine the dynamic response of pavements under dynamic loads and is a useful tool for infrastructure administrations to analyze the pavement bearing capacity.

The interaction between asphalt binder and mineral aggregate is the main cause of forming the interface. This paper presents an extensive review on the test technologies and analysis methods of interfacial interaction, including molecular dynamics simulation, phase field approach, absorption tests, rheological methods and macro mechanical tests. All of the studies conducted on this topic clearly indicated that the interfacial interaction between asphalt binder and mineral aggregate is a physical-chemical process, and can be qualitatively characterized by microscopical technique (such as SEM and AFM), and also can be quantitatively evaluated by rheological methods and interfacial mechanical tests. Molecular dynamics simulation and phase field approach were also demonstrated to be effective methods to study the interfacial behavior and its mechanism.

J	Pinkofsky, L; Jansen, D				Pinkofsky, Lutz; Jansen, Dirk			Structural pavement assessment in Germany	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Review						pavement assessment; Germany; structure; system		The aging structure as well as the considerable increase of heavy-traffic load on Germany's motorways and trunk roads encourages the use of innovative, sound and reliable methods for the structural assessment on network level as well as on project level. Essential elements for this are data, which allow a reliable assessment. For a holistic approach to structural pavement assessment performance orientated measurements will be necessary. In combination with functional parameters as well as write-down models, strategically motivated decision making processes will be useful combined with technically motivated decision processes. For the application at the network level, the available methods for performance orientated measurements are still challenging, as they are based either on testing drill-cores or on nontraffic speed methods. In recent years significant innovation steps have been made to bring traffic speed bearing capacity measurements and methods for evaluating pavement structures on the road. The paper summarizes the actual assessment procedures in Germany as well as the ongoing work on the development and implementation of new methods and techniques.

J	Hill, R; Braham, A				Hill, Robert; Braham, Andrew			Investigating the raveling test for full-depth reclamation	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						raveling; full depth reclamation		Full-Depth Reclamation (FDR) is a sustainable method of building pavement structure compared to more traditional rehabilitation methods. Traffic is generally returned to an FDR project before a surface course is applied, as water in the FDR needs time to evaporate from the structure. This should not be done too quickly or raveling occurs. Currently, there is no test to quantify the timing of return to traffic. In this study, the "Raveling test of cold mixed bituminous emulsion samples" (ASTM D7196) was used to compare asphalt emulsion and asphalt foam FDR. Asphalt emulsion samples were cured at ambient and 40 degrees C temperatures, while asphalt foam samples were cured at ambient temperatures. Raveling test data was collected from 0 to 48 hours of curing, however, samples were often not able to withstand fifteen minutes of testing. Therefore, the "time lasted" (the time the raveling head loses contact with the surface of the sample) was recorded. In general, the asphalt emulsion samples that were cured in the oven at 40 degrees C had a longer time lasted and showed higher potential for determination of return to traffic. In addition, the asphalt emulsion samples had a longer time lasted than the asphalt foam samples at ambient temperatures.

This project aims to evaluate the influence of the freeze-thaw damages on pavement distresses under different climate conditions. Based on the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) data base, the freeze-thaw damage generated by four different kinds of climate conditions are considered in this project: wet-freeze, wet-non freeze, dryfreeze and dry-non freeze. The amount of the transverse crack and the joint spalling, along with the International Roughness Index (IRI) are compared among the test sections located in these four different climate conditions. The back calculation with the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) test results based on the ERES and the Estimation of Concrete Pavement Parameters (ECOPP) methods are conducted to obtain concrete slab elastic modulus and the subgrade k-value. These two parameters both decrease with service time under freeze condition. Finally, MEPDG simulation is conducted to simulate the IRI development with service year. These results showed the reasonable freeze-thaw damage development with pavement service life and under different climate conditions.

J	Han, J; Jiang, Y; Xu, C				Han, Jie; Jiang, Yan; Xu, Cao			Recent advances in geosynthetic-reinforced retaining walls for highway applications	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Review						bridge; geosynthetic; highway; reinforced; wall	STABILIZED EARTH WALL; LOADED DRILLED SHAFT	Geosynthetic-reinforced retaining (GRR) walls have been increasingly used to support roadways and bridge abutments in highway projects. In recent years, advances have been made in construction and design of GRR walls for highway applications. For example, piles have been installed inside GRR walls to support bridge abutments and sound barrier walls. Geosynthetic layers at closer spacing are used in GRR walls to form a composite mass to support an integrated bridge system. This system is referred to as a geosynthetic-reinforced soil (GRS)-integrated bridge systems (IBS) or GRS-IBS. In addition, short geosynthetic layers have been used as secondary reinforcement in a GRR wall to form a hybrid GRR wall (HGRR wall) and reduce tension in primary reinforcement and facing deflections. These new technologies have improved performance of GRR walls and created more economic solutions; however, they have also created more complicated problems for analysis and design. This paper reviews recent studies on these new GRR wall systems, summarizes key results and findings including but not limited to vertical and lateral earth pressures, wall facing deflections, and strains in geosynthetic layers, discusses design aspects, and presents field applications for these new GRR wall systems.

The construction of the Shanghai Center involved excavations in excess of 33-m-deep using the top-down method at a site underlain by thick deposits of marine soft clay. A retaining system was achieved by 50-m-deep diaphragm walls with six levels of struts. During construction, a comprehensive instrumentation program lasting 14 months was conducted to monitor the behaviors of this deep circular excavation. The following main items related to ground surface movements and deformations were collected: (1) walls and circumferential soils lateral movements; (2) peripheral soil deflection in layers and ground settlements; and (3) pit basal heave. The results from the field instrumentation showed that deflections of the site were strictly controlled and had no large movements that might lead to damage to the stability of the foundation pit. The field performance of another 21 cylindrical excavations in top-down method were collected to compare with this case through statistical analysis. In addition, numerical analyses were conducted to compare with the observed data. The extensively monitored data are characterized and analyzed in this paper.

Controlled rocking self-centering system as a modern low-damage system is capable of minimizing the drawbacks of conventional braced frames. This paper quantifies main limit states and investigates the seismic performance of self-centering braced frame using a Probabilistic Safety Assessment procedure. Margin of safety, confidence level, and mean annual frequency of the self-centering archetypes for their main limit states, including PT yield, fuse fracture, and global collapse, are established and are compared with their acceptance criteria. Considering incorporating aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, the efficiency of the system is examined. Results of the investigation indicate that the design of low-and mid-rise self-centering archetypes could provide the adequate margin of safety against exceeding the undesirable limit-states.

In this study, the relations among cyclic behavioral measures and design parameters have been investigated for rectangular RC shear walls using numerical simulations calibrated based on the published laboratory tests. The OpenSEES numerical simulations modeling of plastic hinge hysteretic behavior of RC shear walls and estimation of empirical relations among wall hysteretic indices and design parameters are presented. The principal design parameters considered were wall dimensions, axial force, reinforcement ratios, and end-element design parameters. The estimated hysteretic response measures are wall effective stiffness, yield and ultimate curvatures, plastic moment capacity, yield and ultimate displacements, flexural shear capacity, and dissipated energy. Using results of numerous analyses, the empirical relations among wall cyclic behavioral measures and design parameters are developed and their accuracy is investigated.	[Arab, A.; Banan, Ma.

The geopolymer technology has a viability to substitute traditional concrete made of portland cement (PC) because replacing PC with fly ash leads to reduced carbon dioxide emissions from cement productions and reduced materials cost. Although fly ash geopolymer stimulates sustainability, it is slow geopolymerization reaction poses a challenge for construction technology in term of practicality. The development of increasing geopolymerization reaction rate of the geopolymer is needed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate seeding nucleation agents (NA) of fly ash geopolymer that can accelerate polymerization reactions such that the geopolymer can be widely used in the construction industry. Results from the present study indicate that the use of NA (i.e., Ca(OH)(2)) can be potentially used to increase geopolymerization reaction rate and improve performance characteristics of the fly ash geopolymer product.

The proposed LQR-PID controller, while having the advantage of the classical PID controller, is easy to implement in seismic-excited structures. Using an optimization procedure based on a cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, the LQR-PID controller is designed for a seismic- excited structure equipped with an active tuned mass damper (ATMD). Considering four earthquakes, the performance of the proposed LQR-PID controller is evaluated. Then, the results are compared with those given by a LQR controller. The simulation results indicate that the LQR-PID performs better than the LQR controller in reduction of seismic responses of the structure in the terms of displacement and acceleration of stories of the structure.

Properties of cement grout modified with ultra-fine slag	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						cement grout; ultra-fine slag; flowability; bleeding; viscosity	SILICA	The purpose of the study is to obtain a cement grout with improved performance. The grout mixes of the present study contain cement, ultra-fine slag (UFS), super plasticizer and water. Properties like flowability, bleeding, compressive strength and shrinkage of cement grouts have been studied. Rheological parameters were also studied in order to explain the grout workability. The results show that, cement replacement with slag in grouts could reduce bleeding substantially without affecting the workability of the mixes. Introduction of slag enhanced the compressive strength and reduced shrinkage reasonably. Ultra-fine slag can be used as a supplementary cementitious material in cementitious grouts in order to improve the grout behavior.	[Gopinathan, Sowmini; Anand, K.

Assessment of an alternative to deep foundations in compressible clays: the structural cell foundation	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						deep foundations; bearing capacity; resistant moment; structural cell; 3D numerical modeling	BARRETTE	The new type of deep foundation for buildings on saturated, compressible-low strength clayey soil deposits, branded structural cell essentially consists of a rigid concrete top slab, structurally connected to reinforced concrete peripheral walls (diaphragms) that enclose the natural soil. Accordingly, as the initial volume of the confined soft clays within the lateral stiff diaphragms will remain constant upon loading, the hollowed structural cell will be "transformed" into a very large cross-section pillar of unit weight slightly higher than that of the natural soft clayey soil. This type of foundation seems to be a highly competitive alternative to the friction pile-box foundations (widely used in Mexico City clays), due to its economic and environmental advantages. Economies result, for example, from the absence of huge excavations hence sparing the need of earth retaining structures. Further savings result from appreciably smaller concrete volumes required for building the structural cell than the friction pile-box foundation; moreover, the construction time of the former is much shorter than that of the latter. Regarding the impact to the environment, less air contamination follows from the fact that both traffic jams and soil excavation lessen appreciably. Considering these facts and others regarding scheduling, it was decided to replace 48-friction pile-box foundations specified in the master plan project by this new type of foundation. The overall behavior of these cell foundations over a five-year period is fared from close visual observations and their leveling during the first three years after their construction.

Behavior of rockfill dams considered in this study was defined from the monitoring of a number of 3D sets of pressure cells and extensometers installed in three large dams in Mexico. The 3D analyses results show that high in-plane transversal compressive stresses develop within the concrete panels located in the central concrete face zone upon dam reservoir filling loading. Likewise, in-plane induced tensile transversal stresses in the zones near the abutments increase the potential of slabs cracking and damaging the waterstops in-between the vertical and perimetral joints. From the results of the 3D finite difference analyses, a simple method to estimate in-plane normal stresses in the concrete face is advanced and through comparisons with the results of a 3D case numerical study, its accuracy assessed.

In the first stage, the damage locating vector (DLV) method using normalized cumulative energy (nce) is employed for damage localization in structures. In the second stage, the differential evolution algorithm (DE) is used for damage severity of the structures. In addition, in the second stage, a modification of an available objective function is made for handing the issue of symmetric structures. To verify the effectiveness of the present technique, numerical examples of a 72-bar space truss and a one-span steel portal frame are considered. In addition, the effect of noise on the performance of the identification results is also investigated. The numerical results show that the proposed combination gives good assessment of damage location and extent for multiple structural damage cases.

Among these, nonlinear static procedures are becoming, evermore, the preferred choice of the majority of design codes, as an alternative to complete nonlinear time-history analysis for seismic design and assessment of structures. The many available software tools should therefore be evaluated and well understood, in order to be easily and soundly employed by the practitioners. The study presented herein intends to contribute to this need by providing further insight with respect to the use of commonly employed structural analysis software tools in nonlinear analysis of bridge structures. A comparison between different nonlinear modeling assumptions is presented, together with the comparison with real experimental results. Furthermore, alternative adaptive pushover procedures are proposed and applied to a case study bridge, based on a generic plastic hinge model. The adopted structural analysis program proved to be accurate, yielding reliable estimates, both in terms of local plastic hinge behavior and global structural behavior.

The effect of CNT on the microstructures of cementitious materials has been widely reported. This paper combines a critical review on the effect of CNT on the pore and microstructure of cement composite with a discussion on the porosity measurement of pastes containing CNT using mercury intrusion porosimetry techniques (MIP). It was found that, surface treatment by H2SO4 and HNO3 solution forms carboxyl acid groups on CNTs' surfaces that lead to the improvement of reinforcement. In this scope, this review paper involves analyzing the effect of CNT on the microstructure and the pore structure of cementitious materials. The existing methods of measuring the porosity of cementitious material are reviewed, in particular, the contact angle measurement is discussed in detail in which the most effective parameters and possible errors of calculation is presented.

J	Haddad, M				Haddad, Madhar			Intermediate HSS bracing members during seismic excitations: modeling, design, and behavior	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						HSS; FEM; stress-strain curves; damage model	CONCENTRICALLY BRACED FRAMES; STEEL BRACES; CONNECTIONS	Concentric hollow structural section (HSS) bracing members are used frequently in steel framed structural systems to resist seismic excitations. Finite element modeling of the HSS braces that utilizes the true stress-strain curves produces hysteresis responses that are reasonable matches to the experimental response. True stress-strain curves are obtained from coupon tests or stub-column tests while utilizing an exponential function or strain hardening rule with a trial and error procedure to obtain the hysteresis behavior. In the current study, the true stress-strain curves are directly obtained from tests on stub-columns extracted from the full scale HSS bracing members away from the mid-length plastic hinge after cyclic testing. Two experimental tests (Shaback 2001 and Haddad 2004) were used to validate the model. Results indicate that the stress-strain curves for these braces are not unique. A refined damage accumulation model for ultra-low-cycle fatigue is implemented to predict fracture of the brace tests. The refined damage model is then used in the finite element modeling to predict fracture of braces in a chevron braced frame of an eight-storey building subjected to selected ground motions analyzed using OpenSees program. Results indicate that all braces could sustain the selected earthquake records without fracture.

The effect of sea level rise on beach morphology of caspian sea coast	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						wave; coastal zone; beach morphology; evolution; equilibrium profile; sea level rise	TRANSPORT	Study of beach morphology has been one of the most important issues in coastal engineering research projects. Because of the existence of two important coastal areas located in the north and south parts of the Iran, in the present study an analysis of the coastal zone behaviour is made. Bed level elevations are measured and compared with the theoretical equilibrium profile. It is shown that the behaviour of the coastal zone in the region is consistent with the Dean (1991) equilibrium profile. In the next stage, following extensive investigations, the bed level changes due to arise in sea level at different locations in the surf zone are estimated. The mechanism of beach re-treatment due to a rise in sea level is considered based on the simplified model of Dean (1991) in which the mass balance of the sediments is taken into account. Comparison of the equilibrium profiles for different cases of sea level rise, clearly shows that because of the sediment transport induced by the fluctuation of the water level, the beach profile in the surf zone changes accordingly resulting in an erosion in the inner region of the surf zone and an accumulation of sediments towards the offshore.

In this study AFM was used to investigate the interaction of asphalt binder with fly ash. Fly ash is a coal combustion byproduct of electric power utilities having pozzolanic properties and commonly used in Portland cement concrete. In this study, an investigation was made by using different types of fly ash with two types of asphalt binders such as PG 58-28 and PG 64-28. Asphalt microstructure is divided into four subgroups such as Saturates, Aromatics, Resins and Asphaltenes (SARA). These four phases can be distinguished by the atomic force microscope. The interaction of these phases affected by introducing fly-ash was investigated and correlation with rheological properties was observed.

Plunge point occurs when the mass density current penetrates in the stagnant fluid. Recognition the place of this point is very important because of clearing the boundary of the density current flow and ambient fluid. In this study the influences of bed slope and hydraulic parameters on plunging depth were experimentally investigated. The results show that the slope has a minor effect on the plunging depth.

This study investigates, through an analytical framework, the seismic vulnerability of these and other such buildings, in accordance with the newly developed Building Code of Pakistan - Seismic Provisions 2007 (BCP-SP 07). Detailed failure mode is presented for buildings designed as per the new code. Collapse of structures is predicted for only 8% increase in PGA after moderate damage. A previously developed method, based on Eurocode-8 (2004), is used as baseline. A deficient reinforced concrete frame, typical to local building practices, is analyzed and assessed for vulnerability using the BCP-SP 07 (2007) framework. A comparison is drawn for the same building, based on Eurocode-8 (2004). Derived vulnerability curves show that the previous framework overestimated the damage and hence the vulnerability. Comparison of vulnerability parameters with previous studies show slight difference in performance of buildings.

Compressive strength of SCC mixes was measured after 3, 7, and 28 days of moist curing. It was concluded in this study that increasing the dosage of fly ash increases concrete flow but also decreases segregation resistance. In addition, for the water-to-cement ratio of 0.36 used in this study, it was observed that the compressive strength decreases compared to control mix after 28 days of curing when cement was partially replaced by 10%, 30%, and 40%of fly ash. However, a fly ash replacement ratio of 20% increased the compressive strength by a small margin compared to the control mix. Replacing cement with silica fume at 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% was found to increase compressive strength of SCC mixes compared to the control mix. However, the highest 28 day compressive strength of 95.3 MPa occurred with SCC mixes in which 15% of the cement was replaced with silica fume.

The changing properties of the young concrete complicate the prediction of serviceability design requirements also. An experimental investigation is performed on four simply supported Light-Weight Concrete (LWC) one-way slabs subjected to immediate loading at 14 d. Effects of aggregate type, loading levels and cracking moment together with the influences of ultimate moment capacity and service moment on the instantaneous deflection of slabs are studied. Comparison of the obtained results with predictions of existing models in the literature shows considerable differences between the recorded and estimated instantaneous deflection of LWC slabs. Based on sensitivity analysis of the effective parameters, a new equation is proposed and verified to predict the instantaneous deflection of LWC slabs subjected to loading at the age of 14 d.

In this paper, the seismic response of the Underground subway station-Surrounding soil mass-Ground adjacent buildings (USG) system subjected to various seismic loading is studied through numerical analysis. The numerical model is established in terms of the calculation domain, boundary condition, and contact property between soil and structure based on the real project. The reciprocal influence between subway station and ground adjacent building, and their effects on the dynamic characteristics of surrounding soil mass are also investigated. Through the numerical study, it is found that the impact of underground structure on the dynamic characteristics of the surrounding soil mass depends on its own dimension, and the presence of underground structure has certain impact on the seismic response of ground adjacent building. Due to the presence of underground structure and ground adjacent building, the vertical acceleration generated by the USG system cannot be ignored. The outcomes of this study can provide references for seismic design of structures in the USG system.

Based on PFC2D, the soil arching effect of LSDWs is studied thoroughly in this paper and the special attention is given to its influencing factors. It turns out to be that a differential wall-soil settlement can be found at the lower location of soil core of an LSDW which is one of the trigger factors of soil arching; meanwhile, the differential settlement degree can reflect the exertion degree of soil arching; the shape of soil arching is basically a hemisphere which can be explained by the theory proposed by Hewlett and Randolph; normally, the chamber number is a negative factor for the development of soil arching; the soil arching effect is significantly influenced by the distance of two adjacent wall elements and the foundation depth, and a relatively large or small value of these factors is disadvantageous to the exertion of soil arching; in addition, the soil arching effect increase with the growth of stiffness and friction coefficient of particles and the friction coefficient of particles has insignificant influence on the development of soil arching effect compared with particle stiffness.

Three parameters (wind speed, deck streamlined length and dynamic viscosity of the air) are dedicated to study their effects on the kinetic energy of the system in addition to the shapes and patterns of the vortices. Two benchmarks from the literature Von Karman and Dyrbye and Hansen are considered to validate the vortex shedding aspects for the CFD models. Good agreement between the results of the benchmarks and the semi 3D models has been detected. Latin hypercube experimental method is dedicated to generate the surrogate models for the kinetic energy of the system and the lift forces. Variance based sensitivity analysis is utilized to calculate the main sensitivity indices and the interaction orders for all the three parameters. The kinetic energy approach performed very well in revealing the rational effects and the roles of each parameter in the generation of vortex shedding and predicting vortex induced vibration of the deck.

In this research, low-cost nano-SiO2 particles from natural hydrothermal solutions obtained by membrane ultrafiltration and, optionally, by cryochemical vacuum sublimation drying, were evaluated in portland cement based systems. The SiO2-rich solutions were obtained from the wells of Mutnovsky geothermal power station (Far East of Russia). The constant nano-SiO2 dosage of 0.25% (as a solid material by weight of cementitious materials) was used to compare the cement systems with different nanoparticles against a reference mortar and a commercially available nano-SiO2. Nanoparticles were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), BET Surface Area, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy techniques. It was demonstrated that the addition of polycarboxylate ether superplasticizer and the dispersion treatment using an ultrasound processor can be used to facilitate the distribution of nano-SiO2 particles in the mixing water. The effect of nano-SiO2 particles in portland cement mortars was investigated by evaluating the flow, heat of hydration and compressive strength development. It was demonstrated that the use of nano-SiO2 particles can reduce the segregation and improve strength properties.	[Flores-Vivian, Ismael; Pradoto, Rani G.

The retaining walls were semi-gravity reinforced concrete cantilever type. In the backfill, a 2.74 m thick conventional soil layer was placed over a 3.06 m thick TDA layer. For comparison purpose, a conventional all soil-backfill model was also developed, and the analysis results from the two models under the Northridge and Takatori earthquakes were compared. The FEA results showed that both models did not experience major damage in the backfill under the Northridge earthquake. However, under the Takatori earthquake, the TDA-backfill model developed substantially large displacement in the retaining walls and in the backfill compared with the soil-backfill model. Regions of large plastic strain were mainly formed in the TDA layer, and the soil over the TDA layer did not experience such large plastic strain, suggesting less damage than the soil-backfill model. In addition, the acceleration on the backfill surface of the TDA-backfill model decreased substantially compared with the soil-backfill model. If an acceleration sensitive structure is placed on the surface of the backfill, the TDA backfill may induce less damage to it.

In this study, the stochastic dynamic analysis of soil mass is performed by finite element method in the frequency domain. Two methods are used for stochastic analysis of soil media which are spectral decomposition and Monte Carlo methods. Shear modulus of soil is considered as a random field and the seismic excitation is also imposed as a random process. In this research, artificial neural network is proposed and added to Monte Carlo method for sake of reducing computational effort of the random analysis. Then, the effects of the proposed artificial neural network are illustrated on decreasing computational time of Monte Carlo simulations in comparison with standard Monte Carlo and spectral decomposition methods. Numerical verifications are provided to indicate capabilities, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed strategy compared to the other techniques.

The whole mount is a colossal anticline whose core is consisted of coal measure strata (upper Permian Longtan formation P(2)l) and the limbs are limestone strata (middle Triassic Leikoupo formation T(2)l and lower Triassic Jialingjiang formation T(1)j). The tunneling is full of risks of collapse, gas explosion or gas outburst, water (mud) inrush, gas inrush because of existence of faults, high pressure gas, karst tectonics and coal goafs around the tunnel. In order to cope with the high risk, two main countermeasures were taken to ensure security of construction. One is geology prediction, and the other is automatic wireless real-time monitoring system, which contains monitoring of video, wind speed, poisonous gas (CH4, CO, H2S, SO2), people location, and automatic power-off equipment while gas contents being more than warning threshold. These ascertained the engineering safety effectively.

At the same time, there are nearly 50000-60000 tons of low temperature coal output in inner Mongolia region, China, which has high toxicity and high polluting. To make the low temperature coal be applicable for road constructions, the formaldehyde is used as cross linking agent, the concentrated sulfuric acid is used as catalyst, and the chemical modification of low temperature coal tar pitch in Inner Mongolia region is investigated. The road performance (softening point, penetration and ductility) of modified low temperature coal are tested. Results shown that the road performance of modified low temperature coal is increased significantly. Modification mechanism of low temperature coal is studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy and other analytical tools. Results show that, in the modified low temperature coal, resin content increases and the resin fiber diameter becomes larger with the increasing of formaldehyde content.

The relationships between mechanical properties and textural characteristics have been extensively investigated for differently types of rocks through experimental tests. Based on the experimental test data, single- and multiple- variant regression analyses are conducted among mechanical properties and textural characteristics. Textural characteristics of rock materials are influenced by the following factors: mineral composition, size, shape, and spatial distribution of mineral grains, porosity, and inherent microcracks. This study focuses on the first two: mineral composition and grain size. This study comprehensively summarizes the regression equations between mechanical properties and mineral content and the regression equations between mechanical properties and grain size. Further research directions are suggested at the end of this study.

In order to achieve this aim, a test track was built to provide asphalt mixture specimens and X-ray computed tomography (XCT) device was used to scan the internal structure. The aggregate particles and air-voids were extracted using Digital Image Processing (DIP), so the relationship between compaction and air-voids was determined at first, and then, the effect of aggregate particles on the morphology of air-voids can be evaluated, finally, fatigue properties of asphalt mixture with different air-void ratio were measured by indirect tensile fatigue test as well. The research results release the distribution of microstructures in asphalt pavement. 3D fractal dimension is an effective indicator to quantize the complexity of aggregate particles and air-voids; suffering the same compaction power, aggregates cause different constitutions of air-voids in asphalt mixture; investigation in this paper can present the essential relationship between microstructures and fatigue properties.

Type III cement and Calcium Sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement are the most commonly used fast-setting hydraulic cement (FSHC). In this study, the properties of Type III and CSA cement concrete, including compressive strength, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and shrinkage were evaluated. The test results indicate that compressive strength of FSHC concrete increased rapidly at the early age. CSA cement concrete had higher early-age and long term strength. The shrinkage of CSA cement concrete was lower than that of Type III cement concrete. Both CSA and Type III cement concrete had similar CTE values. Based on the laboratory results, the CSA cement was selected as the partial-depth rapid repair material for a distressed continuously reinforced concrete pavement. The data collected during and after the repair show that the CSA cement concrete had good short-term and long-term performances and, therefore, was suitable for the rapid repair of concrete pavement.

In this paper, the optical microscope is used to acquire the surface morphology of three types of aggregates including basalt, limestone and red sandstone respectively, where a total of 12 indicators are developed based on the surface texture information. The polishing effect on aggregate is simulated by Wehner/Schulze (W/S) device, during the polishing procedure, the skid resistance are measured by British Pendulum Tester (BPT). Based on the results of independent T-test and the polishing resistance analysis, it shows that the surface texture of basalt is significantly different between limestone and red sandstone. Three indicators including the average roughness (Ra), the kurtosis of the surface (Sku) and the mean summit curvature (Ssc) are selected to describe the characteristics of aggregate micro-texture based on the correlation analysis. The contribution of micro-texture to the skid resistance can be described with the secondary polynomial regression model by these indicators.

If the steel arch is prestressed in time, tunnel support can effectively prevent the development of rock crack, thereby increasing the overall strength of tunnel support and suppress the deformation of the surrounding rock. Based on the mechanical model of steel arch established in this paper, the stress distribution of steel arch is investigated via the numerical simulation method, and the impact on surrounding rock is also analyzed. Through a field test, the rules of the arch strain distribution are observed and discussed. The results show that the prestressed steel arch structure can provide effective support and the stress gradually decreases from stress point to another arch springing. Furthermore, the stress distribution applied by the prestressed steel arch on the surrounding rock is uniform in a certain extent, and it is suggested that this construction method utilizing the prestressed steel arch to squeeze surrounding rock is feasible from a theoretical view.

Based on the developed hierarchical approach, three damage computation levels are identified and proposed. The levels of fatigue damage analysis provides pavement engineers a variety of tools that can be used for pavement analysis depending on the availability of data, required level of prediction accuracy and computational power at their disposal. The hierarchical approach also provides a systematic approach for the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of pavement deterioration, the elimination of the empiricism associated with pavement design today and the transition towards the use of sound principles of mechanics in pavement analysis and design.

The cohesion and adhesion of crack sealant directly determine its service performance and durability. However, the competitive mechanism of cohesion and adhesion failure modes is not clear currently. This research proposed two methods to evaluate cohesion and adhesion of crack sealant, and analyzed the influence of temperature on cohesion and adhesion. The effect of moisture on low-temperature performance of crack sealant was also be evaluated by conducting a soaking test. Results show that with the decrease of temperature, the cohesion force of crack sealant increases significantly, while the adhesion force changes little. There is a critical temperature at which the cohesion force equals the adhesion force. When the temperature is higher, the adhesion force will be greater than cohesion force, and the cohesion failure will happen more easily. In contrast, the adhesion failure will happen more easily when the temperature is lower than the critical value. Soaking in 25 A degrees C water for 24-48 hours will slightly improve the low-temperature tension performance of crack sealant. However, soaking in 60 A degrees C water for 24 hours will decrease the failure energy of low-temperature tension and damage the durability of crack sealant.

Two lateral steel beams are added to the middle span of the structure. Frequency analysis is dedicated to obtain the natural frequencies of the first eight mode shapes of vibrations before and after the structural modification approach. Numerical simulations of wind excitations are conducted for the 3D model of the cable stayed bridge with duration of 30 s supporting on real data of a strong wind from the literature. Both vertical and torsional displacements are calculated at the mid span of the deck to analyze both the bending and the torsional stiffness of the system before and after the structural modification. The results of the frequency analysis after applying lateral steel beams declared a safer structure against vertical and torsional vibrations and rarely expected flutter wind speed. Furthermore, the coupling between the vertical and torsional mode shapes has been removed to larger natural frequencies magnitudes with a high factor of safety. The novel structural approach manifested great efficiency in increasing vertical and torsional stiffness of the structure.

The mechanical behavior of the sheathing-to-framing joints has a significant impact on the structural performance of shear walls. Most sheathing-to-framing joints show nonlinear load-displacement characteristics with plastic behavior. This paper is focused on the finite element modeling of shear walls. The purpose is to present a new shear connector element based on the theory of continuum plasticity. The incremental load-displacement relationship is derived based on the elastic-plastic stiffness tensor including the elastic stiffness tensor, the plastic modulus, a function representing the yield criterion and a hardening rule, and function representing the plastic potential. The plastic properties are determined from experimental results obtained from testing actual connections. Load-displacement curves for shear walls are calculated using the shear connector model and they are compared with experimental and other computational results. Also, the ultimate horizontal load-carrying capacity is compared to results obtained by an analytical plastic design method. Good agreements are found.

The MCs and MRACs were designed with different strength grade of mortar and were exposed to different elevated temperatures. Following that the specimens were cooled to room temperature and push-out tests were conducted. Failure process and mechanical behaviors were analyzed based on failure modes, residual load-displacement curves, residual peak loads and peak displacements. It is found that failure modes significantly depended on specimen type, the elevated temperature and the strength grade of mortar. For MC, major cracks started to propagate along the initial cracks caused by elevated temperatures at about 80% of residual peak load. For MRAC, the cracks appeared at a lower level of load with the increasing elevated temperatures. The cracks connected with each other, formed a failure face and the specimens were split into several parts suddenly when reaching the residual peak load. Residual load-displacement curves of different specimens had similarities in shape. Besides, effect of temperatures and strength grade of mortar on residual peak load and peak displacement were analyzed. For MC and MRAC with higher strength of new hardened mortar, the residual peak load kept constant when the temperature is lower than 400 degrees C and dropped by 43.5% on average at 600 degrees C. For MRAC with lower strength of new hardened mortar, the residual peak load began to reduce when the temperatures exceeded 200 degrees C and reduced by 27.4% and 60.8% respectively at 400 degrees C and 600 degrees C. The properties of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) may be more sensitive to elevated temperatures than those of natural aggregate concrete (NAC) due to the fact that the interfacial properties of RAC are lower than those of NAC, and are deteriorated at lower temperatures.

This paper applies the concepts of directed edges and vertex chain operations which are typical for block tracing approach to block assembling approach to construct the structure of three-dimensional fractured rock masses. Polygon subtraction and union algorithms that rely merely on vertex chain operation are proposed, which allow a fast and convenient construction of complex faces/loops. Apart from its robustness in dealing with finite discontinuities and complex geometries, the advantages of the current methodology in tackling some challenging issues associated with the morphological analysis of rock blocks are addressed. In particular, the identification of complex blocks with interior voids such as cavity, pit and torus can be readily achieved based on the number and the type of loops. The improved morphology visualization approach can benefit the pre-processing stage when analyzing the stability of rock masses subject to various engineering impacts using the block theory and the discrete element method.

Impulsive loading, represented by impact and blast, is characterized by a very rapid, time-dependent loading regime in the affected members and materials. Thus, the effect of high-strain-rate loading is initially reviewed. Next the material toughness, an important energy-absorption property and one measure of a material's ability to arrest fracture, is considered by means of studying the Charpy V-notch behavior. The response of hollow sections under axial and lateral impact loading is then reviewed. Studies of blast on hollow sections, most of which fall under the categories of contact/near-field loading or far-field loading are presented. Under large-scale field blast experiments, cold-formed hollow sections have shown excellent behavior. Software for modeling blast loading and structural response, the latter including single degree of freedom analysis and explicit finite element analysis, is described and discussed.

The study considers small strain problem and has been performed using linear as well as nonlinear elastic analysis to determine the interaction effect of two nearby strip footings. The hyperbolic stress-strain relationship has been considered for the nonlinear elastic analysis. The linear elastic analysis has been carried out by deriving the equations for the interference effect of the footings in the framework of Pasternak model equation; whereas, the nonlinear elastic analysis has been performed using the finite difference method to solve the second order nonlinear differential equation evolved from Pasternak model with proper boundary conditions. Results obtained from the linear and the nonlinear elastic analysis are presented in terms of non-dimensional interaction factors by varying different parameters like width of the foundation, load on the foundation and the depth of the rigid base. Results are suitably compared with the existing values in the literature.	[Ghosh, Priyanka; Rajesh, S.; Chand, J.

The more sensitive parameter to the damage is the damping behavior of the structure. The complexity of structural damping mechanisms has made this parameter to be one of the ongoing research topics. Despite all the difficulties in the modeling of damping, there are some approaches like as linear and nonlinear models which are described as the energy dissipation throughout viscous, material or structural hysteretic and frictional damping mechanisms. In the presence of a mathematical model of the damping mechanisms, it is possible to estimate the damping ratio from the theoretical comparison of the damped and un-damped systems. On the other hand, solving the inverse problem of the input force estimation and its distribution to each SDOFs, from the measured structural responses plays an important role in structural identification process. In this paper model-based damping approximation method and a model-less structural input estimation are considered. The effectiveness of proposed methods has been carried out through analytical and numerical simulation of the lumped mass system and the results are compared with reference data. Consequently, high convergence of the comparison results illustrates the satisfactory of proposed approximation methods.

The probability of failure associated with a prescribed criterion (e.g., the maximal inter-storey drift of a building exceeding a certain threshold) is represented as a function of the intensity of the earthquake ground motion (e.g., peak ground acceleration or spectral acceleration). The classical approach relies on assuming a lognormal shape of the fragility curves; it is thus parametric. In this paper, we introduce two non-parametric approaches to establish the fragility curves without employing the above assumption, namely binned Monte Carlo simulation and kernel density estimation. As an illustration, we compute the fragility curves for a three-storey steel frame using a large number of synthetic ground motions. The curves obtained with the non-parametric approaches are compared with respective curves based on the lognormal assumption. A similar comparison is presented for a case when a limited number of recorded ground motions is available. It is found that the accuracy of the lognormal curves depends on the ground motion intensity measure, the failure criterion and most importantly, on the employed method for estimating the parameters of the lognormal shape.

Two common applications are earth stabilization and erosion control. Geosynthetics used for earth stabilization include but are not limited to stabilized slopes, walls, embankments, and roads. Geosynthetics used for erosion control are mostly related to slopes, river channels and banks, and pond spillways. To enhance environmental sustainability, vegetation has been increasingly planted on the facing or surfaces of these earth structures. Under such a condition, geosynthetics mainly function as surficial soil stabilization while vegetation provides green appearance and erosion protection of earth surfaces. Recently, geosynthetic or geosynthetic-like material has been used to form green walls outside or inside buildings to enhance sustainability. Geosynthetics and vegetation are often integrated to provide combined benefits. The interaction between geosynthetics and vegetation is important for the sustainability of the earth and building wall surfaces. This paper provides a review of the current practice and research in the geosynthetic stabilization of vegetated earth and building surfaces for environmental sustainability in civil engineering with the emphases on geosynthetic used for erosion protection, geosynthetic-stabilized slopes, geosynthetic-stabilized unpaved shoulders and parking lots, and geosynthetic-stabilized vegetated building surfaces.

The BBR test has following benefits: the equipment is cheaper, it uses smaller specimens, faster conditioning, easier availability for quality control, easier to manage, etc. However some concerns have been raised: some consider that the size of the aggregate may affect the test's results; the other concern is that such small beams cannot represent the whole properties of the asphalt pavement. To address these criticisms, imaging techniques, statistical analysis, and viscoelastic modeling are used. Asphalt thin beams prepared with three different nominal maximum aggregate size (NMAS) (12.5mm, 9.5 mm, and 4.75 mm) were tested at three different temperatures (-18 degrees C, -24 degrees C, and -30 degrees C). Based on results from statistical analyses and viscoelasticity, the ratio of asphalt binders and voids and stiffness differences among the three NMAS specimens are not significant, meaning that the impact of asphalt thin beams prepared with the three NMAS on the prediction of thermal cracking is minimal and can be neglected.

Investigating the role of exiting vehicles and turn indicator usage in gap acceptance at single-lane roundabouts	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						roundabouts; exiting vehicles; turn indicator use; headways	CAPACITY; INTERSECTIONS	Roundabouts are becoming a preferred form of intersection control type due to their safety and capacity benefits. Yield control at roundabout entries inherently reduces fuel consumption and emissions when compared to other conventional intersection types. However, these benefits can be limited by poor driver behavior and judgment when entering the roundabout. This research addresses the nature of gap distributions and use of turn indicators by exiting vehicles at three single-lane roundabouts in Vermont, New York, and Alaska. Presented here is a comparison of vehicle headways measured at two different locations in each roundabout. Rejected headways are analyzed in the context of priority abstaining events when entering drivers yield to vehicles exiting on the same leg of the roundabout suggesting that "true" critical gaps are being overestimated. Results indicate that exiting vehicles, particularly those that do not use their turn indicators when departing from the major-stream of traffic have an influence on the entry decision of drivers on the same approach. This behavior is of particular concern for intersection efficiency (i.e., delay) and sustainability (i.e., excess fuel consumption and emissions). Results prompt the consideration of more consistent guidance on and enforcement of turn indicator use during roundabout negotiations.

This study developed an integrated life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) model to quantify the impact of pavement preservation on agency cost and vehicle operation cost (VOC) and analyzed the optimal timing of preservation treatments. The international roughness index (IRI) data were extracted from the long-term pavement performance (LTPP) program specific pavement studies 3 (SPS-3) to determine the long-term effectiveness of preservation treatments on IRI deterioration. The traffic loading and the initial IRI value significantly affects life extension and the benefit of agency cost caused by pavement preservation. The benefit in VOC is one to two orders greater in magnitude as compared to the benefit in agency cost. The optimal timing calculated based on VOC is always earlier than the optimal timing calculated based on agency cost. There are considerable differences among the optimal timing of three preservation treatments.

Thus, it is critical to select appropriate tests to properly characterize aggregate durability. In Alaska, durability tests currently being used for aggregates in AC pavement include Los Angeles (LA) abrasion test, sulfate soundness test and Washington degradation test. However, there have long been concerns arising over Washington degradation test used as an acceptance tool, motivating pavement practitioners to seek more suitable alternatives. This paper presents a study to investigate the feasibility of using Micro-Deval test, commonly used in other states, to evaluate the durability of Alaskan aggregates in AC pavement as well as its potential to replaceWashington degradation test. Micro-Deval test,Washington degradation test and other tests currently specified in Alaska were conducted on aggregates from 16 batches representing statewide sources. Based on the testing results, it is found that using Micro-Deval test for durability assessment of Alaska aggregates was feasible and reproducible, and a high potential was revealed to use Micro-Deval test to replace Washington degradation test in Alaska. It is recommended that Micro-Deval test be considered as an additional test for a certain period, but in the long run should be used along with current LA abrasion and sulfate soundness tests to provide a more desirable durability assessment of Alaska aggregates used in AC pavement.

ABAQUS finite element program is utilized to run numerical simulations with the support of MATLAB codes and Fast Fourier Transform FFT technique. The optimum values of these three parameters are validated with two benchmarks from the literature, first with Wang and coauthors and then with Lin and coauthors. The validation procedure detected a good agreement between the results. Box-Behnken experimental method is dedicated to formulate the surrogate models to represent the control efficiency of the vertical and torsional vibrations. Sobol's sensitivity indices are calculated for the design parameters in addition to their interaction orders. The optimization results revealed better performance of the MTMDs in controlling the vertical and the torsional vibrations for higher mode shapes. Furthermore, the calculated rational effects of each design parameter facilitate to increase the control efficiency of the MTMDs in conjunction with the support of the surrogate models.

Finally, these three models are compared with each other and resulted in the fact that ANN and ANFIS models enables us to reliably evaluate the compressive strength of concrete with different mix designs, however, multiple linear regression model is not feasible enough in this area because of nonlinear relationship between the concrete mix parameters. Finally, the sensitivity analysis (SA) for two different sets of parameters on the concrete compressive strength prediction are carried out.

Weir-gate is a combination of weir and gate structures which solves them Infirmities. Proposing a circular shape for crest of weirs to improve their performance, investigators have proposed cylindrical shape to improve the performance of weir-gate structure and call it cylindrical weir-gate. In this research, discharge coefficient of weir-gate was predicated using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). To compare the performance of ANFIS with other types of soft computing techniques, multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) was prepared as well. Results of MLP and ANFIS showed that both models have high ability for modeling and predicting discharge coefficient; however, ANFIS is a bit more accurate. The sensitivity analysis of MLP and ANFIS showed that Froude number of flow at upstream of weir and ratio of gate opening height to the diameter of weir are the most effective parameters on discharge coefficient.

To reduce the loading of deicing constituents in stormwater and to manage the increasing pressure of tightening regulations, identifying fate and transport and evaluating environmental risks of deicing stormwater are of critical importance. In this review, the regulatory development of airport deicing stormwater management was first discussed, along with the milestone Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP) Report 14 publication. The deicer usage and fugitive losses can be reduced and the amount of deicer collected can be increased by having a better understanding of the fate and transport of deicing constituents in stormwater. As such, an overview and evaluation of the constituents of concern in deicers were provided to support the assessment of environmental impacts and mitigation recommendations. The state of knowledge of airport deicing stormwater management was then reviewed, which needs to be synthesized into a national guidance document. A guidebook and a decision tool for airports were proposed to adopt specific practical stormwater management strategies while balancing their priorities in environmental, economic, and social values against operational constraints. These challenges pose great opportunities to improve the current practices of airport deicing stormwater management.

The components of the poly-wall including steel rebars, poly-blocks and RPF cores were simulated and then verified using the results of experiments conducted on the wall components. The results of numerical analysis exhibited a satisfactory agreement with the experimental outcomes for the entire wall system. The verified numerical models were then used to conduct a parametric study on the performance of poly-wall models under uniform wind load and gravity load.

Foundation design for expansive soils is one of the most discussed and problematic issues in Australia as expansive soils were responsible for billions of dollars' worth of damage to man-made structures such as buildings and roads. Several studies and reports indicate that one of the most common and least recognized problems causing severe structural damage to houses lies in expansive soils. In this study, a critical review has been carried out on the current Australian standards for building on expansive soils and they are compared with some techniques that are not included in the current Australian standards for residential slabs and footings. Based on the results of this review, the most effective and economical method has been proposed for construction of footings on all site classifications without restriction to 75mm of characteristic movement. In addition, it has become apparent that as design procedures for footings resting on sites with extreme characteristic movements are not included in the current Australian standards, there is a strong need for well-developed and simplified standard design procedures for characteristic soil movement of greater than 75mm to be included into the Australian Standards.

Shedding frequencies for the associated wind velocities in the lock-in region are calculated in both approaches. The results are validated with Simiu and Scanlan results. The lift and drag coefficients are determined for the two approaches and the latter results are validated with the flat plate theory results by Munson and coauthors. A decrease in the critical wind velocity and the shedding frequencies considering two-way approach was determined compared to those obtained in the one-way approach. The results of the lift and drag forces in the two-way approach showed appreciable decrease in their values. It was concluded that the two-way approach predicts earlier vortex induced vibration for lower critical wind velocities and lock-in phenomena will appear at lower natural frequencies of the long span bridges. This helps the designers to efficiently plan and consider for the design and safety of the long span bridge against this type of vibration.

Enhancing the surface microtexture of pervious concrete may also be beneficial in preventing icing or slipping by pedestrians. This research explored different surface treatments on pervious concrete specimens both qualitatively from personal judgements, and quantitatively through static friction measurements with a spring balance with respect to "slipperiness". The tests were performed on both dry and wet specimens. One aim was to determine whether the spring balance method may be a simple test for comparing surface treatments on pavement samples with little surface area such as laboratory specimens or sidewalk sections. The other purpose was to make a preliminary decision of which surface treatments to use for a sidewalk installation for future studies on wintertime performance. The reliability analysis of the spring balance results showed that there was high operator consistency. In addition, there was a high level of consistency on average results between the quantitative and qualitative methods. This implies that the spring balance test may be an acceptable methodology for comparative analyses with respect to static friction.

It can be monitored, evaluated and predicted through modeling of physical deterioration mechanisms, performance characteristics and parameters and condition monitoring of in situ concrete structures. One such study has been conducted using Non-destructive testing equipment in the city of Bhopal and around located in India. Some selected parameters influencing durability of reinforced concrete (RC) structures such as concrete cover, carbonation depth, chloride concentration, half cell potential and compressive strength have been measured, for establishing correlation among various parameters and age of structures. Effects of concrete cover and compressive strength over the variation of chloride content with time are also investigated.

In this paper, using Flow 3D as CFD commercial tool, the cavitation phenomenon was assessed along spillway's flip bucket of the Balaroud dam. Performance of numerical modeling was compared to the physical model, which was constructed to this purpose. During numerical modeling, it was found that RNG turbulence model is a suitable performance for modeling the cavitation. Physical modeling shows that minimum cavitation index is about 0.85 and minimum cavitation index based on Flow 3D results is about 0.665, which was related to the flood discharge with return period of 10000 years. The main difference between numerical and physical modeling is related to the head of velocity, which is considered in physical modeling. Results of numerical simulation show that occurrence of cavitation based on cavitation index equal to 0.25 is not possible along the spillway.

Many research works and practical achievements of the application of the external reinforcement by using FRP composite materials have been particularly developed in the recent years. This type of strengthening seems promising for the seismic reinforcement of buildings. Among of the components of structures that could affect the stability of the structure in case of an earthquake is the reinforced concrete walls, which require in many cases a strengthening, especially in case where the diagonal cracks can be developed. The intent of this paper is to present a numerical simulation of squat reinforced concrete wall strengthened by FRP composite material (carbon fiber epoxy). The intent of this study is to perform finite element model to investigate the effects of such reinforcement in the squat reinforced concrete walls. Taking advantage of a commercial finite element package ABAQUS code, three-dimensional numerical simulations were performed, addressing the parameters associated with the squat reinforced concrete walls. An elasto-plastic damage model material is used for concrete, for steel, an elastic-plastic behavior is adopted, and the FRP composite is considered unidirectional and orthotropic. The obtained results in terms of displacements, stresses, damage illustrate clearly the importance of this strengthening strategy.

All of generalized non-overload forces acted on a structure forms a convex set when ignoring the second-order effects (coupling effects between the generalized forces). It is true also when the Hessian matrix composed of the second-order partial derivatives on the hypersurface about the ultimate bearing of the structure is negative definite. The outward convexity is kept when the surface is expressed by certain dimensionless parameters. A series of properties based on the convexity are pointed out. Some applications in the analysis of bearing capacity of structures were illustrated with examples. The study shows that an evaluation about the bearing capacity state of a complex structure can be made on the basis of several points on the surface of the ultimate bearing of the structure.

The dynamic reliability analysis for the project is still in search of domestic and international research in the exploration stage. By now, dynamic reliability research mainly concentrates on the reliability assessment; the methods mainly include dynamic fault tree, extension of event sequence diagram and Monte Carlo simulation, and et al. The paper aims to research the dynamic reliability optimization. On the basis of analysis of the four quality influence factors in the construction engineering, a method based on gray correlation degree is employed to calculate the weights of factors affecting construction process quality. Then the weights are added into the reliability improvement feasible index (RIFI). Furthermore, a novel nonlinear programming mathematic optimization model is established. In the Insight software environment, the Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) algorithm is used to get a more accurate construction subsystem optimal reliability under different RIFI conditions. In addition, the relationship between construction quality and construction system reliability is analyzed, the proposed methods and detailed processing can offer a useful reference for improving the construction system quality level.

Initially, the applied evolutionary algorithms, ant colony optimization (ACO) and genetic algorithm (GA) are reviewed, followed by developing the hybrid method. A dynamic hybridization of GA and ACO is proposed as a novel hybrid method which does not appear in the literature for optimal design of steel braced frames. Not only the cross section of the beams, columns and braces are considered to be the design variables, but also the topologies of the braces are taken into account as additional design variables. The hybrid algorithm explores the whole design space for optimum solutions. Weight and maximum displacement of the structure are employed as the objective functions for multi-objective optimal design. Subsequently, using the weighted sum method (WSM), the two objective problem are converted to a single objective optimization problem and the proposed hybrid genetic ant colony algorithm (HGAC) is developed for optimal design. Assuming different combination for weight coefficients, a trade-off between the two objectives are obtained in the numerical example section. To make the final decision easier for designers, related constraint is applied to obtain practical topologies. The achieved results show the capability of HGAC to find optimal topologies and sections for the elements.

By taking the pile group of Guanshandi bridge foundation in Hefei- Fuzhou high-speed railway as the prototype, a model test is carried out. According to the similarity theory, the similar constant is derived and the similar model material is determined. Meanwhile, three types of data including the bearing behavior of piles, and the settlement law, and soil among piles are investigated. It can be found that: the influence of goaf on the bearing capacity of pile is inversely to the loading degree, the larger of loading degree, the smaller impact of goaf on the bearing capacity. There is no negative side friction can been found in pile body and the degree of downward tendency for the barycenter of side friction layout is obvious for piles in goaf. Although the bearing ratio of soil resistance under cap is relatively large, the cap effect is suggested be ignored considering the characteristic of goaf. There is a maximum critical value for the uneven settlement of pile group in goaf, and when the value is reached, the uneven settlement stop growing anymore. In addition, the formula for calculating bearing capacity and settlement of pile group in goaf based on test results, theory analysis and related standard is established.

Inner frictional resistance depends largely on the degree of soil plugging, which is influenced by many factors including pile diameter, relative density and end conditions of piles. In this paper, effects of inner sleeves on inner frictional resistance are discussed. The experiments were conducted on a medium-dense sandy ground using laboratory-scale piles. It was observed that the piles penetrated under partially-plugged or unplugged state. The results suggest that inner frictional resistance, Q (in) increases with sleeve height, l linearly and requires 2D (D is pile outer diameter) of l to produce a large as 50% of Q (t) by Q (in) (Q (t) is total resistance). The results also indicate that bearing capacity increases with wall thickness at the pile tip, which can be attributed to the increase in annular area. The results also indicate that soil plug height is independent of sleeve height. The results also reveal that the penetration of straight piles is closer to unplugged state than the sleeved piles. The results of incremental filling ratio and plug length ratio also indicate that the degree of soil plugging is affected by the sleeve height.

(1) A frame work to design the aircraft wing structure and (2) analysis of a morphing airfoil with auxetic structure. The developed design frame work in the first part is used to arrive at the sizes of the various components of an aircraft wing structure. The strength based design is adopted, where the design loads are extracted from the aerodynamic loads. The aerodynamic loads acting on a wing structure are converted to equivalent distributed loads, which are further converted point loads to arrive at the shear forces, bending and twisting moments along the wing span. Based on the estimated shear forces, bending and twisting moments, the strength based design is employed to estimate the sizes of various sections of a composite wing structure. A three dimensional numerical model of the composite wing structure has been developed and analyzed for the extreme load conditions. Glass fiber reinforced plastic material is used in the numerical analysis. The estimated natural frequencies are observed to be in the acceptable limits. Furthermore, the discussed design principles in the first part are extended to the design of a morphing airfoil with auxetic structure. The advantages of the morphing airfoil with auxetic structure are (i) larger displacement with limited straining of the components and (ii) unique deformation characteristics, which produce a theoretical in-plane Poisson's ratio of-1. Aluminum Alloy AL6061-T651 is considered in the design of all the structural elements. The compliance characteristics of the airfoil are investigated through a numerical model. The numerical results are observed to be in close agreement with the experimental results in the literature.	[Budarapu, P.

This study examined the torsional behavior of TriWP steel sections and compared to that of the flat web (FW) steel sections. Three types of specimen sizes were used: 180 mm x 75 mm x 5 mm x 2 mm, 200 mm x 100 mm x 8 mm x 6 mm, and 200 mm x 100 mm x 6 mm x 5 mm. All the specimens were loaded vertically until the maximum load was achieved and then the load was released. For both types of specimens, it was observed that the torsional rotation for bigger size [200 mm x 100 mm x 8mm x 6 mm] were smaller than that of smaller size [180 mm x 75 mm x 5mm x 2 mm] of the specimens. At the maximum torsional loading, the experimental result was compared to the theoretical calculation. The comparison showed that the percentage difference ranged from 1.10% to 16.80%. From the graph of torsional load versus rotational angle, the torsional rotation for all TriWP steel sections were smaller than that of the FW steel section under the same torsional loading i.e., 0.2 kNm and 1 kNm. The range between FWand TriWP were 3.74 to 71.83 at 0.2 kNm while 14.5 to 75.1 at 1.0 kNm. The findings were shown that the TriWP steel sections had better resistance against torsion in comparison to FW steel section.

The first part addresses the resiliency and sustainability of steel and composite structures from a fundamental standpoint, and it is intended as an introduction to the other six papers that form part of this issue related to resiliency of steel structural systems in seismic areas. The paper posits the idea that resiliency is a characteristic that embodies sustainability rather than the traditional opposite point of view. The second part of the paper is divided into two sections, with the first section describing a number of retrofit technologies with recentering characteristics that have been developed for small, seismically deficient buildings in developing countries. The second section describes an innovative connection between circular concrete filled tubes and conventional beams with reduced flange sections consisting of steel and shape memory alloy bars and end plates. The connection has partial restraint behavior and strong recentering properties. This connection is used to demonstrate that some creative thinking can lead to innovative ways of addressing issues related to robustness, resiliency and sustainability of steel structures.

Experimental study of the restoring force mechanism in the self-centering beam (SCB)	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						self-centering seismic system; seismic design; hysteretic behavior; restoring force; resilient structural system	FRAME SYSTEMS; STEEL FRAMES; PERFORMANCE; CONNECTIONS	In the past, several self-centering (SC) seismic systems have been developed. However, examples of selfcentering systems used in practice are limited due to unusual field construction practices, high initial cost premiums and deformation incompatibility with the gravity framing. A self centering beam moment frame (SCB-MF) has been developed that mitigates several of these issues while adding to the advantages of a typical SC system. The self-centering beam (SCB) is a shop-fabricated, self-contained structural component that when implemented in a moment resisting frame can bring a building back to plumb after an earthquake. This paper describes the SCB concepts and experimental program on five SCB specimens at two-third scale relative to a prototype building. Experimental results are presented including the global force-deformation behavior. The SCBs are shown to undergo 5%-6% story drift without any observable damage to the SCB body and columns. Strength equations developed for the SCB predict the moment capacity well, with a mean difference of 6% between experimental and predicted capacities. The behavior of the restoring force mechanism is described. The limit states that cause a loss in system's restoring force which lead to a decrease in the selfcentering capacity of the SCB-MF, are presented.

The SC-SPSW consists of thin steel infill panels, referred to as web plates that serve as the primary lateral load-resisting and energy dissipating element of the system. Posttensioned (PT) beam-to-column connections provide system recentering capabilities. A performance-based design procedure has been developed for the SC-SPSW, and a series of nonlinear response history analyses have been conducted to verify intended seismic performance at multiple hazard levels. Quasi-static subassembly tests, quasi-static and shake table tests of scaled three-story specimens, and pseudo-dynamic tests of two full-scale two-story SC-SPSWs have been conducted. As a culmination of this multi-year, multi-institutional project, this paper will present an overview of the SCSPSW numerical and experimental research programs. This paper will also discuss innovative PT connection and web plate designs that were investigated to improve constructability, resilience, and seismic performance and that can be applied to other self-centering and steel plate shear wall systems.

J	Yang, TTY; Li, YJ				Yang, Tony T. Y.; Li, Yuanjie			Performance assessment of innovative seismic resilient steel knee braced frame	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						buckling restrained brace; innovative structural system; collapse simulation; seismic assessment	COLLAPSE	Buckling restrained knee braced truss moment frame (BRKBTMF) is a novel and innovative steel structural system that utilizes the advantages of long-span trusses and dedicated structural fuses for seismic applications. Steel trusses are very economical and effective in spanning large distance. However, conventional steel trusses are typically not suitable for seismic application, due to its lack of ductility and poor energy dissipation capacity. BRKBTMF utilizes buckling restrained braces (BRBs) as the designated structural fuses to dissipate the sudden surge of earthquake energy. This allows the BRKBTMF to economically and efficiently create large span structural systems for seismic applications. In this paper, a prototype BRKBTMF office building located in Berkeley, California, USA, was designed using performance-based plastic design procedure. The seismic performance of the prototype building was assessed using the state-of-the-art finite element software, OpenSees. Detailed BRB hysteresis and advanced element removal technique was implemented. The modeling approach allows the simulation for the force-deformation response of the BRB and the force redistribution within the system after the BRBs fracture. The developed finite element model was analyzed using incremental dynamic analysis approach to quantify the seismic performance of BRKBTMF. The results show BRKBTMF has excellent seismic performance with well controlled structural responses and resistance against collapse. In addition, life cycle repair cost of BRKBTMF was assessed using the next-generation performance-based earthquake engineering framework. The results confirm that BRKBTMF can effectively control the structural and non-structural component damages and minimize the repair costs of the structure under different ranges of earthquake shaking intensities. This studies conclude that BRKBTMF is a viable and effective seismic force resisting system.	[Yang, Tony T.

The axial deformation capacity of the DC-SCB is doubled by a parallel arrangement of two inner cores, one outer box and two sets of tensioning elements. This paper presents cyclic test results of a DC-SCB component and a fullscale one-story, one-bay steel frame with a DC-SCB. The DC-SCB that was near 8 m-long was tested to evaluate its cyclic behavior and durability. The DC-SCB performed well under a total of three increasing cyclic loading tests and 60 lowcycle fatigue loading tests without failure. The maximum axial load of the DC-SCB was near 1700 kN at an interstory drift of 2.5%. Moreover, a three-story dual-core self-centering braced frame (DC-SCBF) with a single-diagonal DC-SCB was designed and its first-story, one-bay DC-SCBF subassembly specimen was tested in multiple earthquake-type loadings. The one-story, one-bay subassembly frame specimen performed well up to an interstory drift of 2% with yielding at the column base and local buckling in the steel beam; no damage of the DC-SCB was found after all tests. The maximum residual drift of the DC-SCBF caused by beam local buckling was 0.5% in 2.0% drift cycles.

Through the low-frequency cyclic loading test, the cyclic behavior and failure mode of the specimen were investigated. The results of the test indicated the failure mode and bearing capacity of the specimen which were influenced by the axial compression ratio of the concrete-filled tubular column. On the contrary, the inner diaphragm and inner stiffeners had limited impacts on the hysteretic behavior of the joint. There was no hysteresis damage fracture on the narrow outer diaphragm connected to the concrete-filled steel tubular column with partial joint penetration welds. Due to the excellent ductility and energy dissipating capacity, the proposed joint could be applied to the seismic design of high-rise buildings in highly intensive seismic region, but axial compression ratio should be controlled to avoid unfavorable failure modes.

The proposed approach sets the deformation limit as the numerically computed crack driving force in a fatigue crack at the hot-spot location in the tubular joint reaches the material fracture toughness measured from standard fracture specimens. The calibration of the numerical procedure predicates on reported numerical computations on the crack driving force and previously published verification study against large-scale CHS X-joints with fatigue generated surface cracks. The development of the deformation limit includes a normalization procedure, which covers a wide range of the geometric parameters and material toughness levels. The lower-bound deformation limits thus developed follow a linear relationship with respect to the crack-depth ratio for both X- and K-joints. Comparison of the predicated deformation limit against experimental on cracked tubular X- and K-joints demonstrates the conservative nature of the proposed deformation limit. The proposed deformation limit, when extrapolated to a zero crack depth, provides an estimate on the deformation limits for intact X- and K-joints under brace axial loads.

The emphasis is on assessing the seismic performance for the design basis earthquake (DBE) and maximum considered earthquake (MCE). Three MRF designs were studied, with the MRF designed for 100%, 75%, and 60%, respectively, of the required base shear design strength determined according to ASCE 7-10. The DBF with nonlinear viscous dampers was designed to control the lateral drift demands. Earthquake simulations using ensembles of DBE and MCE ground motions were conducted using the real-time hybrid simulation method. The results show the drift demand and damage that occurs in the MRF under seismic loading. Overall, the results show that a high level of seismic performance can be achieved under DBE and MCE ground motions, even for a building structure designed for as little as 60% of the base shear design strength required by ASCE 7-10 for a structure without dampers.

Seismic performance of composite moment-resisting frames achieved with sustainable CFST members	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						concrete filled steel tubes; rubberized concrete; composite frames; seismic performance assessment	STEEL TUBULAR COLUMNS; TUBE BEAM-COLUMNS; FLEXURAL BEHAVIOR; STUB COLUMNS; DEMOLISHED CONCRETE; FRESH CONCRETE; CONNECTIONS; DESIGN	The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to study the bending behaviour of Concrete Filled Steel Tube (CFST) columns made with Rubberized Concrete (RuC), and to assess the seismic performance of moment-resisting frames with these structural members. The paper describes an experimental campaign where a total of 36 specimens were tested, resorting to a novel testing setup, aimed at reducing both the preparation time and cost of the test specimens. Different geometrical and material parameters were considered, namely cross-section type, cross-section slenderness, aggregate replacement ratio, axial load level and lateral loading type. The members were tested under both monotonic and cyclic lateral loading, with different levels of applied axial loading. The test results show that the bending behaviour of CFST elements is highly dependent on the steel tube properties and that the type of infill does not have a significant influence on the flexural behaviour of the member. It is also found that Eurocode 4 is conservative in predicting the flexural capacity of the tested specimens. Additionally, it was found that the seismic design of composite momentresisting frames with CFST columns, according to Eurocode 8, not only leads to lighter design solutions but also to enhanced seismic performance in comparison to steel frames.

The present research addresses the effect of surface coatings on service life of onshore RC structures. Long-term performance of concrete samples up to 88 months of exposure at natural marine environment was investigated. Two onshore exposure conditions, including soil and atmosphere and different types of concrete coatings were studied. Carbonation rates of up to 0.5 and 1.5 mm/year were observed at the first 88 months of exposure for soil and atmospheric samples, respectively. Surface chloride ion build-up and variation in chloride ion diffusion were monitored with respect to time, and service life was estimated. Based on the obtained results it is proposed to use the aliphatic acrylic and polyurethane coatings for enhancing the service life of concrete structures in the investigated exposure conditions.

The RS was applied to study the paste from 12 hours after mixing to 28 days. Cement ingredients and hydration products, including calcium silicates (C3S and C2S), calcium hydroxide (CH), and ettringite, were quantitatively studied. From the research, it is observed that calcium silicates were consumed gradually with the increased hydration age. Calcium hydroxide increased and tended to cluster in the pore vicinity during hydration. Ettringite was found to form on the surface of the unreacted particles, which was shown as a mixed zone of ettringite and calcium silicates in the maps. It is concluded from the study that chemical mapping was an effective method to assist in visualizing particle dispersion and connection on top of the quantitative analysis.

The MWCNT dispersion was produced with a solids concentration of 3.0 % by mass and an anionic surfactant as dispersing agent. Cement pastes with water-to-cement ratio of 0.45 and additions of solid MWCNT by mass of cement up to 0.50 % were studied. Isothermal calorimetry results showed a clear retardation of the hydration of cement caused by the surfactant contained in the MWCNT dispersion. Nevertheless, thermogravimetric evaluations showed that once the hydration reaction resumed, the retardation effect of the surfactant did not have a negative impact on the amount of hydration products precipitated. It was concluded that the commercial MWCNT dispersion presents a good potential to be applied in oil well cement pastes.

New approach to determine the plastic viscosity of self-compacting concrete	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						rheology; viscosity; V-funnel; flow profile; rheometer; behavior	FRESH CONCRETE; FILLER; DURABILITY; HYDRATION	The rheology of concrete is best measured with the use of a rheometer. The slump flow test gives a good indication of the flowability of the mixture and is therefore still used extensively to judge the workability of SCC mixtures. However, this test presents some defects. The objective of this paper is to develop a new methodology for measuring the workability of a SCC. In this article, we have proposed a correlation between the plastic viscosity of concrete, the time and the characteristics of the flow final profile from the V-funnel coupled to a Plexiglas horizontal channel. The proposed approach, verified by experimental results, represents a simple, economical and usable tool on building site, and it allows to characterize rheologically the SCC from its flow. The comparison between our approach and the experimental values of the plastic viscosity shows that, in a laboratory or on site, instead of using a rheometer we can use our approach to characterize the rheological behavior of a SCC.

The radial pressure is equilibrated by hoop tension undertaken by the concrete cover. Owing to concrete's poor tensile properties in terms of strength and deformability, the equilibrium is instantly released upon radial cracking of the cover along the anchorage with commensurate abrupt loss of the bond strength. Any improvement of the matrix tensile properties is expected to favorably affect bond in terms of strength, resilience to pullout slip, residual resistance and controlled slippage. The aim of this paper is to investigate the local bond of steel bars developed in adverse tensile stress conditions in the concrete cover. In the tests, the matrix comprises a novel, strain resilient cementitious composite (SRCC) reinforced with polypropylene fibers (PP) with the synergistic action of carbon nano-tubes (CNT). Local bond is developed over a short anchorage length occurring in the constant moment region of a four-point bending short beam. Parameters of investigation were the material structure (comprising a basic control mix, reinforced with CNTs and/or PP fibers) and the age of testing. Accompanying tests used to characterize the cementitious material were also conducted. The test results illustrate that all the benefits gained due to the synergy between PP fibers and CNTs in the matrix, namely the maintenance of the multi-cracking effect with time, the increased strength and deformability as well as the highly increased material toughness, were imparted in the recorded bond response. The local bond response curves thus obtained were marked by a resilient appearance exhibiting sustained strength up to large levels of controlled bar-slip; the elasto-plastic bond response envelope was a result of the confining synergistic effect of CNTs and the PP fibers, and it occurred even without bar yielding.

The autogenous shrinkage in the fresh stage was investigated. The CNTs and CNFs were characterized by high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the hydrated pastes were studied by X-ray diffraction and SEM. The results showed a reduction of the autogenous shrinkage by 50% for pastes containing small amounts (0.01 wt%) of nanomaterials. Higher additions appeared to be less effective. The highest reduction of shrinkage was observed for carbon nanofibers which were long, rather straight and had diameters of around 200 nm. The result showed that the addition of nanomaterials accelerated the hydration processes especially in the early stages of hydration. The effect was the most pronounced in the case of functionalized nanotubes. The proposed mechanism resulting in the reduction of the autogenous shrinkage was a combination of nano-reinforcing effects, alterations of hydration and microstructure of the hydrated matrix.

Quantification of hydration products in cementitious materials incorporating silica nanoparticles	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						degree of hydration; porosity; calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H); silica nanoparticles	COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; NANO-SILICA; POROSIMETRY; CONCRETE; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS; PASTES	In the present work, silica nanoparticles (30-70nm) were supplemented into cement paste to study their influence on degree of hydration, porosity and formation of different type of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) gel. As the hydration time proceeds, the degree of hydration reach to 76% in nano-modified cement paste whereas plain cement achieve up to 63% at 28 days. An influence of degree of hydration on the porosity was also determined. In plain cement paste, the capillary porosity at 1hr is similar to 48%, whereas in silica nanoparticles added cement is similar to 35 % only, it revealed that silica nanoparticles refines the pore structure due to accelerated hydration mechanism leading to denser microstructure. Similarly, increasing gel porosity reveals the formation of more C-S-H gel. Furthermore, C-S-H gel of different Ca/Si ratio in hydrated cement paste was quantified using X-ray diffractometer and thermogravimetry. The results show that in presence of silica nanoparticles, similar to 24% C-S-H (Ca/Si<1.0) forms, leading to the formation of polymerised and compact C-S-H. In case of plain cement this type of C-S-H was completely absent at 28 days. These studies reveal that the hydration mechanism of the cement can be tuned with the incorporation of silica nanoparticles and thus, producing more durable cementitious materials.	[Singh, L.

The attachment of hydroxyl functional groups to the walls of the MWCNTs were verified using FTIR spectroscopy. The dispersion of CNTs with acid treatment is assessed using UV-Vis spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that the duration of the acid treatment has significant effect on both the degree of defects and functionality of the MWCNT. The compressive strength of mortar increased with the addition of the acid-treated MWCNTs; however, no appreciable difference was noted for the two treatment durations under this study.

TiO2 sols are blended with fresh cement paste as an alternative process to add photocatalytic functionality to cement. The modification of cement paste structure after the addition of TiO2 sols is analyzed by XRD, SEM and TGA. As a particular microstructural feature, TiO2 containing calcium silicate hydrate (C-H-S) particles are identified as networking centers of a C-S-H gel fiber matrix. The increase of the TiO2 sol concentration induces a decrease of pore size and an increase in the specific surface area in the cement composites. The photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/cement system is evaluated from the degradation of Methylene Blue (MB) under UV irradiation, monitored through the absorbance at 665 nm. The results show that, although TiO2 phases reveal no long range order structure, the cement paste exothermal treatment in presence of hydrate products and alkaline conditions leads to a photocatalytic composite. Such new cement matrix may be twofold advantageous since it additionally promotes the formation of C-S-H gel, main determinant of cement mechanical properties.

Besides, video-based system is global measurement. The technical basis of video-based remote vibration measurement system is digital image analysis. Comparison of the images allow the field of motion to be accurately delineated. Such information is important to understand the structure behaviors including the motion and strain distribution. This paper presents system and analyses to monitor the vibration velocity and displacement field. The performance is demonstrated on a testbed of model building. Three different methods (i.e., frame difference method, particle image velocimetry, and optical Flow Method) are utilized to analyze the image sequences to extract the feature of motion. The Performance is validated using accelerometer data. The results indicate that all three methods can estimate the velocity field of the model building, although the results can be affected by factors such as background noise and environmental interference. Optical flow method achieved the best performance among these three methods studied. With further refinement of system hardware and image processing software, it will be developed into a remote video based monitoring system for structural health monitoring of transportation infrastructure to assist the diagnoses of its health conditions.

J	Guo, Y; Yu, X				Guo, Yuan; Yu, Xiong (Bill)			Design and analyses of open-ended pipe piles in cohesionless soils	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						open-ended pipe pile; soil plug; DEM; base capacity	BEHAVIOR; SAND	Large open-ended pipe pile has been found to be advantageous for use in transportation projects. The current design method, however, is not adequately developed. To close this practice gap, this paper first summarized different design methods for open-ended pipe piles in sandy soils. A major factor for all the design codes is to properly account for the formation and effects of soil plug. The comparison indicates that there is a large variation in the base capacity evaluation among different methods due to the complex behaviors of soil plug. To close the knowledge gap, discrete element method (DEM) was used to simulate the soil plugging process and provide insight on the plugging mechanism. The simulation results show that the arching effect significantly increases the internal unit shear resistance along pipe piles. The porosity distribution and particle contact force distribution from DEM model indicate a large stress concentration occurs at the bottom of the soil plug. Besides, nearly 90% of the plug resistance is provided by the bottom half portion of the soil column. The soil-pile friction coefficient has a significant effect on the magnitude of plug resistance, with the major transition occurred for friction coefficient between 0.3 and 0.4.

J	Han, J; Shiwakoti, H				Han, Jie; Shiwakoti, Harihar			Wheel tracking methods to evaluate moisture sensitivity of hot-mix asphalt mixtures	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						hot-mix asphalt; moisture sensitivity; rutting; wheel tracking test		Existing test methods to determine moisture sensitivity in hot-mix asphalt (HMA) mixtures are time consuming and inconsistent. This research focused on wheel tracking devices to evaluate moisture sensitivity. The Asphalt Pavement Analyzer (APA) and the Hamburg Wheel Tracking Device (HWTD) were used for this research. Compacted cylindrical samples were fabricated using a Superpave Gyratory compactor. This study selected two most commonly used mixtures, SM-12.5A with PG 64-22 binder in overlay projects and SM-19A mixtures with PG 64-22 binder for major modification projects at Kansas Department of Transportation. Test results show that APA tests could induce stripping in most samples without any anti-stripping agent, which could be identified visually. However, APA results did not indicate any stripping inflection point while the HWTD results showed stripping inflection points, which are important to identify stripping potential of mixtures. The APA results show that wet tests are severe at lower temperatures. The HWTD results show improvement in the performance using anti-stripping agents at later stage. The HWTD test is more effective as a rapid test method in case of determining moisture sensitivity. Laboratory results from this study should be verified and correlated with field performance.

However, the inherent linear elastic behavior of FRP materials up to rupture is considered as a major drawback under seismic attacks when significant material inelasticity is required to dissipate the input energy through hysteretic cycles. Besides, cost considerations, including FRP material and construction of pre-fabricated FRP configurations, especially for stirrups, and probable damage to epoxy coated fibers when transported to the field are noticeable issues. The current research has proposed a novel economical hybrid reinforcement scheme for the next generation of infrastructures implementing on-site fabricated FRP stirrups comprised of FRP sheets. The hybrid reinforcement consists of conventional longitudinal steel reinforcement and FRP stirrups. The key feature of the proposed hybrid reinforcement is the enhanced strength and ductility owing to the considerable confining pressure provided by the FRP stirrups to the longitudinal steel reinforcement and core concrete. Reinforced concrete beam specimens and beam-column joint specimens were tested implementing the proposed hybrid reinforcement. The proposed hybrid reinforcement, when compared with conventional steel stirrups, is found to have higher strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation. Design methods, structural behavior, and applicability of the proposed hybrid reinforcement are discussed in detail in this paper.

Pseudo-static tests were performed to evaluate the seismic behavior of the PRCFW system. Two one-bay, two-story PRCFW specimens were both built at one-half scale. Additional computational research is also conducted to enhance the nonlinear analytical capabilities for this system. Combined with the concrete damaged plastic (CDP) model provided by finite element program ABAQUS and the constitutive model of concrete proposed by Chinese code, the damage process of the PRCFW structure under cyclic load is simulated. The simulated results show a good agreement with the test data, the dynamic behavior of the PRCFW system can be simulated sufficiently accurate and efficient to provide useful design information. The experimental and numerical study show that this system has the potential to offer good ductility and energy absorption capacity to dissipate input energy, and stiffness adequate for controlling drift for buildings located in earthquake-prone regions.

Recently, stayed-cables were also proved that they could be excited in dry state (without rain), which is called dry-galloping. Recently, its mechanisms have been explained by axial flow, Reynolds number and so on. To clarify the characteristics of this galloping, wind tunnel test of a cable model with various kinds of wind angle was conducted. Then, three types of countermeasure were examined to suppress dry-galloping of bridge cable. The tests confirmed that the occurrence of dry-galloping depends on relative wind attacked angles and onset reduced wind speed. Furthermore, single spiral wire, double spiral wire and circular ring were found to have high effectiveness in mitigating this galloping when those are installed properly.

The bridge model and vehicle model were independently built which have no internal relationship in the ANSYS. The vehicle-bridge coupled vibration relationship was obtained by using the APDL program which subsequently imposed on the vehicle and bridge models during the numerical analysis. The proposed model was validated through a field measurements and literature data. The judging method, possibility, and criterion of the vehicle-bridge resonance (coupled vibrations) of cable stayed bridges (both the floating system and half floating system) under traffic flows were presented. The results indicated that the interval time between vehicles is the main influence factor on the resonance excitation frequency under the condition of equally spaced traffic flows. Compared to other types of cable stayed bridges, the floating bridge system has relatively high possibility to cause vehicle-bridge resonance.

Objective of the study is the development of an economically superior suspension bridge with 500-1,000 m center span length. The wind-tunnel test showed that an edge-girder type cross section exhibited large amplitude torsional vortex-induced vibration as well as torsional flutter at a low wind speed. Accordingly, aerodynamic countermeasures of open grating deck and triangular faring, and structural countermeasures of center stay, diagonal bracing and mass increase were tried to improve the aerodynamic stability. Finally, feasibility of the best combination to a full-scale bridge was examined by structural analysis.

Then, a simplified method for the determination of pile-soil interface parameters in layered soil is proposed based on the parameter studies. Finally, a filed loading test is used for the validation of the simplified method, and the calculated results agree well with the monitoring data. In general, the simplified method proposed in this paper works with higher accuracy and consumes less time compared with the traditional trial works, especially on the determinations of interfacial cohesive and interfacial friction angle.

Chloride binding and time-dependent surface chloride content models for fly ash concrete	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						binding isotherms; chloride ingress; concrete; fly ash; surface chloride content	CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; MARINE-ENVIRONMENT; SERVICE LIFE; PORE SOLUTION; TRANSPORT; DIFFUSION; CORROSION; CAPACITY; STEEL	Corrosion of embedded rebars is a classical deterioration mechanism of reinforced concrete structures exposed to chloride environments. Such environments can be attributed to the presence of seawater, deicing or sea-salts, which have high concentrations of chloride ion. Chloride ingress into concrete, essential for inducing rebar corrosion, is a complex interaction between many physical and chemical processes. The current study proposes two chloride ingress parameter models for fly ash concrete, namely: 1) surface chloride content under tidal exposure condition; and 2) chloride binding. First, inconsistencies in surface chloride content and chloride binding models reported in literature, due to them not being in line with past research studies, are pointed out. Secondly, to avoid such inconsistencies, surface chloride content and chloride binding models for fly ash concrete are proposed based upon the experimental work done by other researchers. It is observed that, proposed models are simple, consistent and in line with past research studies reported in literature.

These responses may be considered in lieu of code-specified load effects in which the overall accuracy may be influenced by the inherent simplifications in codes. In addition, this new automated approach is particularly attractive and advantageous as it allows a web-based online analysis/design via intuitive user-friendly interfaces for both the input and output in terms of familiar web-style forms that are nowadays very common in most of web-based services. Presently, the DEDM-LR hosts an aerodynamic database developed by the Tokyo Polytechnic University (TPU), Japan for a variety of building configurations like flat, gable, and hip roofs under suburban terrain flow condition with immediate application to other databases. The paper shows the efficacy and validity of the DEDM-LR by walking through its details and examples on selected gable-roofed buildings. The architecture of DEDM-LR platform offers the ability to pool resources by hosting other databases that may become available in the near future.

J	Shi, XM				Shi, Xianming			Experimental and modeling studies on installation of arc sprayed Zn anodes for protection of reinforced concrete structures	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						arc sprayed Zn; anode replacement; reinforced concrete; bridge preservation; neural networks; surface profile	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CATHODIC PROTECTION; CORROSION; PREVENTION; STEEL; ZINC; STRENGTH	Arc sprayed zinc (Zn) anode on concrete surfaces has been an emerging technology for protecting reinforced concrete structures from rebar corrosion in coastal environments. Many cathodic protection (CP) systems with arc sprayed Zn anodes will reach or exceed their design life in the near future and thus may function improperly or insufficiently, making it necessary to replace the aged anodes. However, prior to this study, little was known about the most effective profile for the concrete surface, for either new concrete or old concrete with existing Zn anodes removed. This work develops criteria to properly prepare the concrete surface before the application of new Zn anode. Experimental studies were conducted both in the laboratory and for a field structure in Oregon. Artificial neural network was used to achieve better understanding of the complex cause-and-effect relationships inherent in the Zn-mortar or Zn-concrete systems and was successful in finding meaningful, logical results from the bond strength data. The goal is to achieve strong initial bond strength of new Zn to concrete, which is essential for long-term performance of the CP system. The results from this case study suggest that it is necessary to adjust the anode removal and surface sandblasting based on the electrochemical age of the existing concrete. In all cases of sandblasting, minimize the exposure of large aggregates (e.g., those bigger than 19 mm in diameter).

An extended cell-based smoothed discrete shear gap method (XCS-FEM-DSG3) for free vibration analysis of cracked Reissner-Mindlin shells	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						cracked Reissner-Mindlin shell; free vibration analysis; cell-based smoothed discrete shear gap method (CS-FEM-DSG3); extended cell-based smoothed discrete shear gap method (XCS-FEM-DSG3); smoothed finite element methods (SFEM)	FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD; FUNCTIONALLY GRADED PLATES; SOLID MECHANICS PROBLEMS; METHOD NS-FEM; LAMINATED COMPOSITE PLATES; UPPER BOUND SOLUTIONS; MESHFREE THIN SHELL; METHOD FS-FEM; ALPHA-FEM; DEFORMATION-THEORY	A cell-based smoothed discrete shear gap method (CS-FEM-DSG3) was recently proposed and proven to be robust for free vibration analyses of Reissner-Mindlin shell. The method improves significantly the accuracy of the solution due to softening effect of the cell-based strain smoothing technique. In addition, due to using only three-node triangular elements generated automatically, the CS-FEM-DSG3 can be applied flexibly for arbitrary complicated geometric domains. However so far, the CS-FEM-DSG3 has been only developed for analyzing intact structures without possessing internal cracks. The paper hence tries to extend the CS-FEM-DSG3 for free vibration analysis of cracked Reissner-Mindlin shells by integrating the original CS-FEM-DSG3 with discontinuous and crack - tip singular enrichment functions of the extended finite element method (XFEM) to give a so-called extended cell-based smoothed discrete shear gap method (XCS-FEM-DSG3). The accuracy and reliability of the novel XCS-FEM-DSG3 for free vibration analysis of cracked Reissner-Mindlin shells are investigated through solving three numerical examples and comparing with commercial software ANSYS.

Both temperature and displacement approximations are extrinsically enriched by Heaviside and crack front enrichment functions. Crack growth is modelled by successive linear extensions, and the end points of these linear extensions are joined by cubic spline segments to obtain a modified crack front. Different crack geometries such as planer, non-planer and arbitrary spline shape cracks are simulated under thermal shock, adiabatic and isothermal loads to reveal the sturdiness and versatility of the XFEM approach.

Self-healing concrete (SHC) is a heterogeneous material which has different constituents as cement matrix, sand and healing agent carrying capsules. Computational homogenization tool is applied in this paper to evaluate the effective properties of self-healing concrete. With this technique, macro and micro scales are bridged together which forms the basis for multi-scale modeling. Representative volume element (RVE) is a small (microscopic) cell which contains all the microphases of the microstructure. This paper presents a technique for RVE design of SHC and shows the influence of volume fractions of different constituents, RVE size and mesh uniformity on the homogenization results.	[Quayum, Md.

The butterfly composite specimens were fabricated with 0.02, 0.05 and 0.1 wt % CNTs. The polyester/CNT composite was fabricated using VRTM (Vacuum Resin Transfer Molding) where the CNTs were first functionalised to reach an optimum properties. Arcan test rig was designed and fabricated to work with the Shimadzu testing machine. The results show that the functionalised CNTs have improved the fracture behavior by acting as bridge between the cracked face. In addition, the fracture properties were not improved for the higher weight fraction of 0.1 wt% CNTs.

This formulation employs the consistently coupled isogeometric-meshfree strategy where a mixed basis vector of the convex B-splines is used to impose the consistency conditions throughout the whole problem domain. Meanwhile, the rigid body modes related to the mixed basis vector and reproducing conditions are also discussed. The mixed basis vector simultaneously offers the consistent isogeometric-meshfree coupling in the coupled region and the quasi-convex property for the meshfree shape functions in the meshfree region, which is particularly attractive for the vibration analysis. The quasi-convex meshfree shape functions mimic the isogeometric basis function as well as offer the meshfree nodal arrangement flexibility. Subsequently, this approach is exploited to study the free vibration analysis of cracked plates, in which the plate geometry is exactly represented by the isogeometric basis functions, while the cracks are discretized by meshfree nodes and highly smoothing approximation is invoked in the rest of the problem domain. The efficacy of the present method is illustrated through several numerical examples.

The stress-strain response of the material is modeled by Ramberg-Osgood equation. The von-Mises failure criterion has been used with isotropic hardening. The J-integral for two fracture modes (mode-I and mode-II) is obtained by decomposing the displacement and stress fields into their symmetric and antisymmetric parts, then individual stress intensity factors are extracted from J-integral. The fatigue life obtained by EPFM is found quite close to that obtained by LEFM.	[Kumar, Sachin; Shedbale, A. S.; Singh, I. V.; Mishra, B.

The effect of parameters namely, maximum tangential contact stress, tangential slip distance and artificial damping coefficient on the debonding length at the interface of the fiber-matrix is analyzed. Contact elements used in the CZM are coupled based on a bilinear stress-strain curve. Load is applied on the matrix, tangential to the interface. Hence, debonding is observed primarily in Mode II. Wide range of values are considered to study the inter-dependency of the parameters and its effect on debonding length. Out of the three parameters mentioned, artificial damping coefficient and tangential slip distance significantly affect debonding length. A thorough investigation is recommended for case wise interface debonding analysis, to estimate the optimal parametric values while using CZM.

Adaptive selective ES-FEM limit analysis of cracked plane-strain structures	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						cracked structure; limit analysis; von Mises criterion; edge-based strain smoothing; second-order cone programming; adaptive	FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD; SHAKEDOWN ANALYSIS; LOWER BOUNDS; COMPUTATION; ALGORITHM; FIELDS; LOADS; FORMULATION; SPECIMENS	This paper presents a simple and efficient approach for predicting the plastic limit loads in cracked plane-strain structures. We use two levels of mesh repartitioning for the finite element limit analysis. The master level handles an adaptive primal-mesh process through a dissipation-based indicator. The slave level performs the subdivision of each triangle into three sub-triangles and constitutes a dual mesh from a pair of two adjacent sub-triangles shared by common edges of the primal mesh. Applying a strain smoothing projection to the strain rates on the dual mesh, the incompressibility constraint and the flow rule constraint are imposed over the edge-based smoothing domains and everywhere in the problem domain. The limit analysis problem is recast into the compact form of a second-order cone programming (SOCP) for the purpose of exploiting interior-point solvers.

An extended thermo-mechanically coupled algorithm for simulation of superelasticity and shape memory effect in shape memory alloys	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						shape memory alloy; thermo-mechanical coupling; superplasticity; shape memory effect	CONSTITUTIVE MODEL; NITI	Thermo-mechanical coupling in shape memory alloys is a very complicated phenomenon. The heat generation/absorption during forward/reverse transformation can lead to temperature-dependent variation of its mechanical behavior in the forms of superelasticity and shape memory effect. However, unlike the usual assumption, slow loading rate cannot guarantee an isothermal process. A two-dimensional thermo-mechanically coupled algorithm is proposed based on the original model of Lagoudas to efficiently model both superelasticity and shape memory effects and the influence of various strain rates, aspect ratios and boundary conditions. To implement the coupled model into a finite element code, a numerical staggered algorithm is employed. A number of simulations are performed to verify the proposed approach with available experimental and numerical data and to assess its efficiency in solving complex SMA problems.

The layer number n is an arbitrary nonnegative integer. The mathematical theory of linear elasticity is one of the most classical field theories in mechanics and physics. It was developed and established by many well-known scientists and mathematicians over 200 years from 1638 to 1838. For more than 150 years from 1838 to present, one of the remaining key tasks in classical elasticity has been the mathematical derivation and formulation of exact solutions for various boundary value problems of interesting in science and engineering. However, exact solutions and/or fundamental singular solutions in closed form are still very limited in literature. The boundary-value problems of classical elasticity in n-layered and graded solids are also one of the classical problems challenging many researchers. Since 1984, the author has analytically and rigorously examined the solutions of such classical problems using the classical mathematical tools such as Fourier integral transforms. In particular, he has derived the exact and complete fundamental singular solutions for elasticity of either isotropic or transversely isotropic layered solids subject to concentrated loadings. The solutions in n-layered or graded solids can be calculated with any controlled accuracy in association with classical numerical integration techniques. Findings of this solution formulation are further used in the companion paper for mathematical verification of the solutions and further applications for exact and complete solutions of other problems in elasticity, elastodynamics, poroelasticty and thermoelasticity. The mathematical formulations and solutions have been named by other researchers as Yue's approach, Yue's treatment, Yue's method and Yue's solution.

It involves three levels of the mathematical verifications. The first level is to show that Yue's solution can be automatically and uniformly degenerated into these classical solutions in closed-form such as Kelvin's, Boussinesq's, Mindlin's and bi-material's solutions when the material properties and boundary conditions are the same. This mathematical verification also gives and serves a clear and concrete understanding on the mathematical properties and singularities of Yue's solution in n-layered solids. The second level is to analytically and rigorously show the convergence and singularity of the solution and the satisfaction of the solution to the governing partial differential equations, the interface conditions, the external boundary conditions and the body force loading conditions. This verification also provides the easy and executable means and results for the solutions in n-layered or graded solids to be calculated with any controlled accuracy in association with classical numerical integration techniques. The third level is to demonstrate the applicability and suitability of Yue's approach, Yue's treatment, Yue's method and Yue's solution to uniformly and systematically derive and formulate exact and complete solutions for other boundary-value problems, mixed-boundary value problems, and initial-boundary value problems in layered solids in the frameworks of classical elasticity, boundary element methods, elastodynamics, Biot's theory of poroelasticity and thermoelasticity. All of such applications are substantiated by peer-reviewed journal publications made by the author and his collaborators over the past 30 years.

Aseismic smart building isolation systems under multi-level earthquake excitations: Part I, conceptual design and nonlinear analysis	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						tuned mass damper; smart building isolation; resettable device; non-linear; statistical assessment	TUNED MASS DAMPER; FEASIBILITY	As a novel structural control strategy, tuned mass damper (TMD) inspired passive and semi-active smart building isolation systems are suggested to reduce structural response and thus mitigate structural damage due to earthquake excitations. The isolated structure's upper stories can be utilized as a large scaled TMD, and the isolation layer, as a core design point, between the separated upper and lower stories entails the insertion of rubber bearings and (i) viscous dampers (passive) or (ii) resettable devices (semi-active). The seismic performance of the suggested isolation systems are investigated for 12-story reinforced concrete moment resisting frames modeled as "10 + 2" stories and "8 + 4" stories. Passive viscous damper or semi-active resettable devices are parametrically evaluated through the optimal design principle of a large mass ratio TMD. Statistical performance metrics are presented for 30 earthquake records from the three suites of the SAC project. Based on nonlinear structural models, including P-delta effects and modified Takeda hysteresis, the inelastic time history analyses are conducted to compute the seismic performances across a wide range of seismic hazard intensities. Results show that semi-active smart building isolation systems can effectively manage seismic response for multi-degree-of freedom (MDOF) systems across a broader range of ground motions in comparison to uncontrolled case and passive solution.

Several different model cases of the strategically isolated multi-story building structures utilizing passive dampers and semi-active resettable devices are analyzed and the energy-based target indices are compared. Performance comparisons are conducted on statistically calculated story/structural hysteretic energy and story/structural damage demands over realistic suites of earthquake ground motion records, representing seismic excitations of specific return period probability. Again, the semi-active solutions show significant promise for applications of resettable device, offering advantages over passive systems in the consistent damage reductions. The specific results of this study include the identification of differences in the mechanisms by which smart building isolation systems remove energy, based on the differences in the devices used. Less variability is also seen for the semi-active isolation systems, indicating an increased robustness.

Response in piled raft foundation of tall chimneys under along-wind load incorporating flexibility of soil	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						finite element method; piled raft; tall chimney; soil-structure interaction; along-wind load	BOUNDARY-ELEMENT ANALYSIS; VERTICAL LOADS; LAYERED SOILS	The present paper deals with the numerical analysis of tall reinforced concrete chimneys with piled raft foundation subjected to along-wind loads considering the flexibility of soil. The analysis was carried out using finite element method on the basis of direct method of soil-structure interaction (SSI). The linear elastic material behavior was assumed for chimney, piled raft and soil. Four different material properties of soil stratum were selected in order to study the effect of SSI. The chimney elevation and the thickness of raft of piled raft foundation were also varied for the parametric study. The chimneys were assumed to be located in terrain category 2 and subjected to a maximum wind speed of 50 m/s as per IS: 875 (Part 3)-1987. The along-wind loads were computed according to IS: 4998 (Part 1)-1992. The base moments of chimney evaluated from the SSI analysis were compared with those obtained as per IS: 4998 (Part 1)-1992. The tangential and radial bending moments of raft of piled raft foundation were evaluated through SSI analysis and compared with those obtained from conventional analysis as per IS: 11089-1984, assuming rigidity at the base of the raft foundation. The settlements of raft of piled raft foundation, deflection of pile and moments of the pile due to interaction with different soil stratum were also evaluated. From the analysis, considerable reduction in the base moment of chimney due to the effect of SSI is observed. Higher radial moments and lower tangential moments were obtained for lower elevation chimneys with piled raft resting on loose sand when compared with conventional analysis results. The effect of SSI in the response of the pile is more significant when the structure-foundation system interacts with loose sand.	[Jayalekshmi, B. R.; Jisha, S.

To better characterize the material properties under dynamic loading, interface properties of the composite were investigated through direct shear test and also used to validate the interface model. Strain rate effects of the asphalt concrete were also studied and both compressive and tensile dynamic increase factor (DIF) curves were improved based on split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) test. A full-scale field blast test investigated the blast behavior of the composite materials. The numerical model was established by taking into account the strain rate effect of all concrete materials. Furthermore, the interface properties were also considered into the model. The numerical simulation using nonlinear finite element software LS-DYNA agrees closely with the experimental data. Both the numerical and field blast test indicated that the SHS composite exhibited high resistance against blast loading.

It is usually assumed that the morphology of a random microstructure can be described as a non-Gaussian random field that is completely defined by its multivariate distribution. A particular kind of non-Gaussian random fields with great practical importance is that of translation fields resulting from a simple memory-less transformation of an underlying Gaussian field with known second-order statistics. This paper provides a critical examination of existing random field models of heterogeneous two-phase media with emphasis on level-cut random fields which are a special case of translation fields. The case of random level sets, often used to represent the geometry of physical systems, is also examined. Two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the basic features of the different approaches.

In particular, influence of a microscopic random variation of the elastic properties of component materials on mechanical properties of the laminated plate is investigated. Laminated composites are widely used in civil engineering, and therefore multiscale stochastic analysis of laminated composites should be performed for reliability evaluation of a composite civil structure. This study deals with the stochastic response of a laminated composite plate against the microscopic random variation in addition to a random variation of fiber orientation in each lamina, and stochastic properties of the mechanical responses of the laminated plate is investigated. Halpin-Tsai formula and the homogenization theory-based finite element analysis are employed for estimation of effective elastic properties of lamina, and the classical laminate theory is employed for analysis of a laminated plate. The Monte-Carlo simulation and the first-order second moment method with sensitivity analysis are employed for the stochastic analysis. From the numerical results, importance of the multiscale stochastic analysis for reliability evaluation of a laminated composite structure and applicability of the sensitivity-based approach are discussed.

First, based on the tests of 14 aluminum alloy beams under concentrated loads, the failure pattern, load-deformation curves, bearing capacity and flexural-torsional buckling factor are studied. It is found that all the beam specimens collapsed in the flexural-torsional buckling with excessive deformation pattern. Moreover, the span, loading location and slenderness ratio influence the flexural-torsional buckling capacity of beams significantly. Secondly, besides the experiments, a finite element method (FEM) analysis on the flexural-torsional buckling behavior of AAB is also conducted. The main parameters in the FEM analysis are initial imperfection, material property, cross-section and loading scheme. According to the analytical results, it is indicated that the FEM is reasonable to capture mechanical behavior of AAB. Finally, on the basis of the experimental and analytical results, theoretical formulae to estimate the flexural-torsional buckling capacity of AAB are proposed, which could improve the application of present codes for AAB.

J	Abbasa, JM; Chik, Z; Taha, MR				Abbasa, Jasim M.; Chik, Zamri; Taha, Mohd Raihan			Influence of axial load on the lateral pile groups response in cohesionless and cohesive soil	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						piles; pile group; spacing; configuration; combined load	VERTICAL LOAD; BEHAVIOR; SAND	The lateral response of single and group of piles under simultaneous vertical and lateral loads has been analyzed using a 3D finite element approach. The response in this assessment considered lateral pile displacement and lateral soil resistance and corresponding p-y curve. As a result, modified p-y curves for lateral single pile response were improved with respect to the influence of increasing axial load intensities. The improved plots can be used for lateral loaded pile design and to produce the group action design p-multiplier curves and equations. The effect of load combination on the lateral pile group response was performed on three pile group configurations (i.e., 2 x 1, 2 x 2 and 3 x 2) with four pile spacings (i.e., s = 2D, 4D, 6D and 8D). As a result, design curves were developed and applied on the actual case studies and similar expected cases for assessment of pile group behavior using improved p-multiplier. A design equation was derived from predicted design curves to be used in the evaluation of the lateral pile group action taking into account the effect of axial load intensities. It was found that the group interaction effect led to reduced lateral resistance for the pile in the group relative to that for the single pile in case of pure lateral load. While, in case of simultaneous combined loads, large axial load intensities (i.e., more than 6H, where H is lateral load values) will have an increase in p-multiplier by approximately 100% and will consequently contribute to greater group piles capacities.

Both a rigid foundation and an elastic foundation are considered. Assuming both the side surface and the bottom surface of the foundation are perfectly bonded to soil, the reaction torques that the side soil and bottom soil acting on the foundation can be gained from basic dynamic equations of the poroelastic medium. According to the dynamic equilibrium equations of a foundation under harmonic torque, the torsional vibrations of an embedded cylindrical foundation are presented. Besides, the angular amplitude of the foundation, the equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients of the soil are expressed explicitly. Selected examples are presented to investigate the influence of relevant parameters on the torsional vibrations.

A numerical model for the timber-steel hybrid shear wall system was developed and verified against test results. Design parameters, such as the lateral infill-to-frame stiffness ratio and the arrangements of wood-steel bolted connections were studied using the numerical model. Some design recommendations were also proposed based on the parametric analysis. In the hybrid shear wall system, the infill wood wall was found to resist a major part of the lateral load within relatively small wall drifts, and then the steel frame provided more lateral resistance. Under seismic loads, the infill wood wall could significantly reduce the inter-story drift of the hybrid system, and a complementary effect between the infill wood wall and the steel frame was observed through different lateral load resisting mechanisms, which provided robustness to the hybrid shear wall systems.

However, the global character inherent to the limited number of modal properties issued from operational modal analysis may be not appropriate for early-damage, which has generally a local character. The present paper aims at detecting this type of damage by using static SHM data and by assuming that early-damage produces dead load redistribution. To achieve this objective a data driven strategy is proposed, consisting of the combination of advanced statistical and machine learning methods such as principal component analysis, symbolic data analysis and cluster analysis. From this analysis it was observed that, under the noise levels measured on site, the proposed strategy is able to automatically detect stiffness reduction in stay cables reaching at least 1%.

The historic infrastructure, completed in 1889 and crossing the Adda river about 50 km far from Milan, is the most important monument of XIX century iron architecture in Italy and is still used as roadway and railway bridge. The monitoring project follows a series of preliminary ambient vibration tests carried out on the bridge since June 2009. The paper describes the bridge structure and its dynamic characteristics identified from the experimental studies developed since 2009, the installed monitoring system and the software developed in LabVIEW for automatically processing the collected data. Subsequently, the tracking of automatically identified natural frequencies over a period of about 18 months is presented and discussed, highlighting the effects of environmental and operational conditions on the bridge dynamic characteristics as well as the detection of structural changes, mainly based on natural frequencies shifts.

The flow of air over a backward facing step has been investigated numerically using FLUENT. Flow simulation has been carried out in a backward facing step having an expansion ratio (ratio of the height before and after the step) of 1:1.94 and the results obtained are compared with the published experimental results. Comparison of flow characteristics between steps with three different transitions is made. The variation of reattachment length for all the three cases are analyzed for wide range of Reynolds number ranging from 100 to 7000 which covers the laminar, transition and turbulent flow of air. Simulation of the flow over steps with expansion ratios of 1:1.24, 1:1.38, 1:1.47, 1:1.53, 1:1.94, 1:2.20 are also carried out to examine the effect of different expansion ratios on the reattachment length. It is found that the primary reattachment length increases with increase in the expansion ratio. The primary reattachment length at the bottom wall downstream of the step is minimum for the step with round edged transition and maximum for the step with a vertical drop transition.

Investigation of sediment transport pattern and beach morphology in the vicinity of submerged groyne (case study: Dahane Sar Sefidrood)	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						submerged groyne; non-submerged groyne; beach morphology; Dahane Sar Sefidrood; sediment transport		Marine structures, such as Groynes, Sea walls and Detached Breakwaters, are constructed in coast of area to improve coast stability against bed erosions due to changing wave and current pattern. Marine mechanisms and interaction with the hydraulic structures need to be intensively studied. Groynes are one of the most prominent structures that are used in shore protection and littoral sediment. The main hydraulic function of the groyne is to control the long shore current and littoral sediment transport. This structure can be submerged and provide the necessary beach protection without negative aesthetic impact. However, for submerged structures adopted for beach protection, the shoreline response to these structures is not well understood. The objective of this study is to predict sediment transport in the vicinity of submerged groyne and comparison with non-submerged groyne focusing on a part of the coast at Dahane Sar Sefidrood, Guilan Province, Iran, where serious coast erosion has been occurred. The simulations were designed using a one-line model which can be used as a first approximation of shoreline prediction in the vicinity of groyne. The results of the proposed model are compared with experimental data to determine the shape of the coast. The results of predicted beach deformation show that when submerged groyne construct in the beach, sediment accumulation will be slightly less than the non-submerged groyne; because transfer coefficient for the submerged groyne is more than non-submerged groyne. This result will cause more sediment passing on submerged groyne. Finally, the result of the present study show that using submerged groyne is an efficient way to control the sediment and beach erosion without causing severe environmental effect on the coast.

Numerical studies were performed on a 5-story shear-wall building model to validate the applicability of the presented approach, using two damage patterns. With the numerical simulations, the proposed approach accurately determined the damage ratio of the specimens. Experiments were also conducted on a 5-story shear-wall building model for which the system parameters were almost the same as those in numerical simulations. The estimated damage-quantification results from the experimental validations demonstrated that the performance of the presented method for shear-wall buildings was both suitable and accurate.

Advances have been made to increase the power efficiency of the wind turbines while less attention has been focused on structural integrity assessment of the structural systems. Vibration-based damage detection has widely been researched to identify damages on a structure based on change in dynamic characteristics. Widely spread methods are natural frequency-based, mode shape-based, and curvature mode shape-based methods. The natural frequency-based methods are convenient but vulnerable to environmental temperature variation which degrades damage detection capability; mode shapes are less influenced by temperature variation and able to locate damage but requires extensive sensor instrumentation which is costly and vulnerable to signal noises. This study proposes novelty of damage factor based on sensor fusion to exclude effect of temperature variation. The combined use of an accelerometer and an inclinometer was considered and damage factor was defined as a change in relationship between those two measurements. The advantages of the proposed method are: 1) requirement of small number of sensor, 2) robustness to change in temperature and signal noise and 3) ability to roughly locate damage. Validation of the proposed method is carried out through numerical simulation on a simplified 5 MW wind turbine model.

This model used the combination of qualitative and quantitative analytic hierarchy process, to meet the multi-level, multi-objective characteristics of evaluation index system. The evaluation index system and evaluation model can be used to analysis the ecological suitability of port projects comprehensively and have some guiding significance to the port ecological suitability evaluation.
